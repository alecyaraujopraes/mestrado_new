Estimates of casualties of the Vietnam War vary widely. Estimates include both civilian and military deaths in North and South Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. The conflict persisted from 1955 to 1975 and most of the fighting took place in South Vietnam; accordingly it suffered the most casualties. The war also spilled over into the neighboring countries of Cambodia and Laos which also endured casualties from aerial and ground fighting. Civilian deaths caused by both sides amounted to a significant percentage of total deaths. Civilian deaths were partly caused by assassinations, massacres and terror tactics. Civilian deaths were also caused by mortar and artillery, extensive aerial bombing and the use of firepower in military operations conducted in heavily populated areas. Some 365,000 Vietnamese civilians are estimated by one source to have died as a result of the war during the period of American involvement. A number of incidents occurred during the war in which civilians were deliberately targeted or killed. The best - known are the Massacre at Huế and the My Lai massacre.|Vietnam War|1975|('Vietnam War', '1975')|(4, 5)|Vietnam War persisted from to 1975

Standard Oil Co. Inc. was an American oil producing, transporting, refining, and marketing company. Established in 1870 by John D. Rockefeller and Henry Flagler as a corporation in Ohio, it was the largest oil refinery in the world of its time. Its history as one of the world's first and largest multinational corporations ended in 1911, when the United States Supreme Court, in a landmark case, ruled that Standard Oil was an illegal monopoly. Standard Oil dominated the oil products market initially through horizontal integration in the refining sector, then, in later years vertical integration; the company was an innovator in the development of the business trust. The Standard Oil trust streamlined production and logistics, lowered costs, and undercut competitors. \"Trust - busting\" critics accused Standard Oil of using aggressive pricing to destroy competitors and form a monopoly that threatened other businesses. Rockefeller ran the company as its chairman, until his retirement in 1897. He remained the major shareholder, and in 1911, with the dissolution of the Standard Oil trust into 34 smaller companies, Rockefeller became the richest man in the world, as the initial income of these individual enterprises proved to be much bigger than that of a single larger company. Its successors such as ExxonMobil or Chevron are still among the companies with the largest income worldwide. By 1882, his top aide was John Dustin Archbold. After 1896, Rockefeller disengaged from business to concentrate on his philanthropy, leaving Archbold in control. Other notable Standard Oil principals include Henry Flagler, developer of the Florida East Coast Railway and resort cities, and Henry H. Rogers, who built the Virginian Railway.|Standard Oil Co.

The Imperial Brazilian Navy (Portuguese: Armada Nacional, commonly known as Armada Imperial) was the navy created at the time of the independence of the Empire of Brazil from the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. It existed between 1822 and 1889 during the vigency of the constitutional monarchy. The Navy was formed almost entirely by ships, staff, organizations and doctrines proceeding from the transference of the Portuguese Royal Family in 1808. Some of its members were native - born Brazilians, who under Portugal had been forbidden to serve. Other members were Portuguese who adhered to the cause of separation and German and Irish mercenaries. Some establishments created by King João VI were used and incorporated. Under the reign of Emperor Pedro II the Navy was greatly expanded to become the fifth most powerful navy in the world and the armed force more popular and loyal to the Brazilian monarchy. The republican coup d'état in 1889, led by army men, put an end to the Imperial Navy that fell into decay until the new century.|The Imperial Brazilian Navy|1889|('The Imperial Brazilian Navy', '1889')|(0, 1)|The Imperial Brazilian Navy existed between 1822 1889

Samuel Musgrave, FRS (29 September 1732 – 5 July 1780) was an English classical scholar and physician. Musgrave was born at Washfield in Devon, and was educated at the University of Oxford. There he was elected to a Radcliffe travelling fellowship, and he spent several years abroad. In 1766 he settled at Exeter, but moved to Plymouth to improve his career prospects. Everything went wrong when he published a pamphlet in the form of an address to the people of Devon, accusing certain members of the British government of having been bribed by the French government to conclude the Treaty of Paris (1763), and declaring that Chevalier Charles d'Eon de Beaumont, the French minister plenipotentiary to England, had in his possession documents which would prove the truth of his assertion. Eon de Beaumont denied all knowledge of any such transaction and of Musgrave himself, and the House of Commons in 1770 decided that the charge was unsubstantiated. The discredited Musgrave was obliged to earn a meagre living in London by writing until his death, in reduced circumstances. He wrote several medical works, now forgotten; and his edition of Euripides (1778) was a considerable advance on that of Joshua Barnes.|Samuel Musgrave|Exeter|('Samuel Musgrave,', 'Exeter,')|(0, 1)|Samuel Musgrave settled at Exeter,

Fort Sumter is a sea fort in Charleston, South Carolina, notable for two battles of the American Civil War. It was one of a number of special forts planned after the War of 1812, combining high walls and heavy masonry, and classified as Third System, as a grade of structural integrity. Work started in 1829, but was incomplete by 1860, when South Carolina seceded from the Union. The First Battle of Fort Sumter began on April 12, 1861, when Confederate artillery fired on the Union garrison. These were the first shots of the war and continued all day, watched by many civilians in a celebratory spirit. The fort had been cut off from its supply line and surrendered the next day. The Second Battle of Fort Sumter (September 8, 1863) was a failed attempt by the Union to retake the fort, dogged by a rivalry between army and navy commanders. Although the fort was reduced to rubble, it remained in Confederate hands until it was evacuated as General Sherman marched through South Carolina in February 1865. Fort Sumter is open for public tours as part of the Fort Sumter National Monument operated by the National Park Service.|Fort Sumter|Fort Sumter National Monument|('Fort Sumter (', 'September 8, 1863)')|(2, 3)|Fort Sumter is as part of the Fort Sumter National Monument

Some add new words and instrumentation to mimic the sounds of animals mentioned in the lyrics. American soul music singer Sam Cooke adapted the song using a more uptempo approach and it became a successful single on both the US rhythm and blues and pop record charts in 1963. Concurrently, Dixon and Howlin' Wolf toured the UK with the American Folk Blues Festival and helped popularize Chicago blues with local rock musicians overseas. The Rolling Stones were among the first British rock groups to record modern electric blues songs. In 1964, they recorded \"Little Red Rooster\" with original member Brian Jones, a key player in the recording. Their rendition, which remains closer to the original arrangement than Cooke's, became a number one record in the UK and continues to be the only blues song to reach the top of the British chart. The Stones frequently performed it on television and in concert and released several live recordings of the song. \"Little Red Rooster\" continues to be performed and recorded, making it one of Willie Dixon's best - known compositions.|The Rolling Stones|Brian Jones|('The Rolling Stones', 'original member Brian Jones,')|(2, 6)|The Rolling Stones recorded "Little Red Rooster" with original member Brian Jones,

Avellaneda is a department of the Río Negro Province, Argentina. It is crossed by the Negro River forming a fertile valley known as the Valle Medio. The river bifurcates and then both arms join again forming two main islands known as Isla Grande de Choele Choel and Isla Chica de Choele Choel and a few smaller ones. The Isla Grande holds the towns of Luis Beltrán, Lamarque and Pomona, as well as the most fertile area of the department, with cultivations of tomatoes, apples and pears among the most important. Choele Choel, on the other side of the river from the Isla Grande and at the intersection of Argentine National Route 22 and Provincial Route 250 that crosses the island, is the transport hub of the area with an important long - distance bus terminal, and an airport currently operating only private flights. Through Darwin, outside the fertile valley, passes the railway that connects Buenos Aires with Bariloche, but the line is currently almost inactive, with occasional cargo - train traffic that does n't stop at the town.|the Negro River|the Valle Medio|('the Negro River', 'the Valle Medio.')|(4, 5)|the Negro River forming a fertile valley known as the Valle Medio.
The Elbe Lateral Canal (;), is a long canal in Lower Saxony, Germany. It runs from the Mittelland Canal near Gifhorn to the Elbe in Artlenburg. It forms an important transport connection between southern and northern Germany, and it provides a bypass of a section of the Elbe with limited navigability. At the construction start it was also thought as a bypass outside the GDR, considered politically unreliable. Construction of the Elbe Lateral Canal was started in 1968, and the canal was opened in June 1976. Due to a dam rupture, it was closed from July 1976 until June 1977. The difference in elevation between the Mitteland Canal and the Elbe is, which is overcome by a lock at Uelzen and the Scharnebeck twin ship lift, a boat lift at Scharnebeck. There are small ports along the canal in Lüneburg, Uelzen and Wittingen, and a landing stage at Wulfstorf (near Bienenbüttel).|The Elbe Lateral Canal (;),|the Mitteland Canal|('The Elbe Lateral Canal (;),', 'the Mitteland Canal')|(4, 6)|The Elbe Lateral Canal (;), runs from the Mitteland Canal

Johnny Mathis Sings the Music of Bacharach & Kaempfert is an album by American pop singer Johnny Mathis that was released in the fall of 1970 by Columbia Records. While one half of the two - record set was a compilation of tracks from his previous albums that were composed by Burt Bacharach, the other consisted of new recordings of songs composed by Bert Kaempfert, including a new version of \"Strangers in the Night\", which Mathis had already recorded in 1966 for his LP Johnny Mathis Sings. Although the Kaempfert tribute was similar to recent Mathis albums in that he was mainly covering songs made popular by other singers, it was absent of hits from the 12 months previous to its release that had become the pattern of his output at this point. The latest US chartings of any of the Kaempfert compositions as of this album's debut came from 1967 recordings of \"Lady\" by Jack Jones and \"The Lady Smiles\" by Matt Monro. The album made its first appearance on Billboard magazine's Top LP's chart in the issue dated January 23, 1971, and reached number 169 during its seven weeks there.

The Head of Janus () is a 1920 German horror silent film directed by F. W. Murnau. The film was an unauthorized adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson's novel The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, but the source material went unrecognized by some of the German media due to changes in the characters' names. Released on 17 September 1920 by the Lipow Co., this is one of Murnau's lost films. The screenplay was written by Hans Janowitz, who collaborated with Carl Mayer on the script for The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1919). While the film itself does not survive, the scripts and related production notes do.

General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was an office of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) that by the late 1920s had evolved into the most powerful of the Central Committee's various secretaries. With a few exceptions, from 1929 until the union's dissolution the holder of the office was the de facto leader of the Soviet Union, because the post controlled both the CPSU and the Soviet government. Joseph Stalin elevated the office to overall command of the Communist Party and by extension the whole Soviet Union. Nikita Khrushchev renamed the post First Secretary in 1953; the change was reverted in 1966. The office grew out of less powerful secretarial positions within the party: Technical Secretary (1917 – 1918), Chairman of the Secretariat (1918 – 1919), Responsible Secretary (1919 – 1922) (when Lenin was leader of the party of Bolsheviks).|General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|the Communist Party|('General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union', 'the Communist Party')|(4, 6)|General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union was an office of the Communist Party

Salmo aphelios is a species of trout, a salmonid fish endemic to Lake Ohrid in Macedonia and Albania in the Balkans. S. aphelios is one of four different forms of the Ohrid trout complex within the single lake, along with S. balcanicus, S. letnica, and S. lumi. The various trout forms, which have been suggested to be different species, are distinguished by their breeding time and habitat, by which they in practice are thought to be reproductively isolated from each other. Genetic data have not supported their distinction, though. S. aphelios specifically spawns from May to July near the underwater springs on the eastern shore of the lake, at the Macedonian - Albanian border area. Its flesh is typically of orange colour. Overall, the Ohrid trouts are silvery in colour, with black dots. Red dots occur along the lateral line.

Goodbyeee, or \"Plan F: Goodbyeee\", is the sixth and final episode of the British historical sitcom Blackadders fourth series, entitled Blackadder Goes Forth. The episode was first broadcast on BBC1 in the United Kingdom on 2 November 1989, shortly before Armistice Day. Apart from the one - off short film made a decade later, it was the last episode of Blackadder to be produced and transmitted. The episode depicts its main characters' final hours before a British offensive on the Western Front of the First World War, and Captain Blackadder's attempts to escape his fate by feigning madness; after he fails to convince General Melchett, and Field Marshal Haig's advice proves useless, he resigns himself to taking part in the push. Goodbyeee has a darker tone than other episodes in the series, culminating in its acclaimed ending in which the main characters are assumed to die in machine - gun fire. The episode's theme of death ties in with the series' use of gallows humour, its criticism and satire of war, and its depiction of authority figures contentedly sending their subordinates to face the enemy, while unwilling to do so themselves. Richard Curtis and Ben Elton wrote the episode, and further material was provided by cast members. Its final sequence, which shows the main characters going \"over the top\", uses slow motion, as the programme's creators were unhappy with the result of the scripted ending. The enhanced scene has been described as bold and highly poignant.|Plan F: Goodbyeee|Blackadders fourth series|('\"Plan F: Goodbyeee\",', 'Blackadders fourth series,')|(2, 3)|Goodbyeee, is the sixth and final episode of the British historical sitcom Blackadders fourth series,

The PocketStation is a Memory Card peripheral by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation home video game console. Categorized by Sony as a combination of a Memory Card and a miniature personal digital assistant, the device features a monochrome liquid crystal display (LCD), infrared communication capability, a real - time clock, built - in flash memory, and sound capability. To use the device's memory card functionality, it must be connected to a PlayStation through a memory card slot. It was released exclusively in Japan on January 23, 1999. Software for the PocketStation was typically distributed as extras for PlayStation games, included in the CD - ROM, enhancing the games with added features. Stand - alone software could also be downloaded through the PlayStation console. The software is then transferred to the PocketStation for use. A built - in infrared data interface allows direct transfer of data such as game saves between PocketStation units, as well as multiplayer gaming. The original Japanese ship date for the PocketStation was set for December 23, 1998, but it was delayed a full month. Sony only shipped an initial 60,000 units of the peripheral when it was released on January 23, 1999. It was initially available in two case colors: white and clear. It proved extremely popular, selling out all over the region. Sony planned to release the PocketStation outside Japan, engaging in promotional activity in Europe and North America, but the release did not occur. SCEA cited an inability meeting Japanese demand as the reason for the PocketStation's absence. Despite this, a few games, such as Final Fantasy VIII and SaGa Frontier 2, retained PocketStation functionality in their localized versions. The PocketStation's most popular game was Dokodemo Issho, which sold over 1.5 million copies in Japan and is the first game to star Sony's mascot Toro. The PocketStation was discontinued in July 2002 after having shipped nearly five million units. On November 5, 2013, it was announced that the PocketStation would be revived as an application for the PlayStation Vita, allowing users to play PocketStation format minigames for any classic PlayStation games that they own.

Solid Rock is a 1972 album by The Temptations for the Gordy (Motown) label, produced by Norman Whitfield. The LP was the first made primarily without founding members and original lead singers Eddie Kendricks and Paul Williams. Frustrated by conflicts and fights with Temptations Otis Williams and Melvin Franklin, and producer Whitfield's steadfast insistence on producing psychedelic soul for the group when they really wanted to sing ballads, Kendricks had quit the act and negotiated a solo deal with Motown's Tamla label. Paul Williams, on the other hand, had fallen ill due to complications from sickle - cell disease and six years of untreated alcoholism. Physically incapable of performing any longer, Williams followed his doctor's advice and retired from the act, although he remained on the Temptations' payroll as a choreographer until committing suicide on August 17, 1973.

Jonas Geirnaert (born July 28, 1982) studied animation at the KASK in Ghent. In May 2004 he won the Short Film Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival with his animated short Flatlife (11 min). Of the copy he sent in for selection only the first minute had sound. This is because this was his graduation project, and it was n't completely finished at the final date for selection entries. Although Flatlife has no political message, Jonas' previous movie, The All - American Alphabet, clearly has one. On stage in Cannes, Jonas had a message for all Americans: \"Do n't vote Bush\". At that moment such statements were very popular, however his political preference has to be situated in the extreme - left corner as he is a militant for the marxist party Workers Party of Belgium. In the fall of 2005 Geirnaert made the TV comedy series Neveneffecten for Canvas (public Flemish television) with his fellow comedians Lieven Scheire, Koen De Poorter and Jelle De Beule. In 2011 this same group of four made the television show BASTA which also offered satirical critique on current cultural phenomenon, like help desks, uncritical journalism, television call games, the production of meat and internet scammers. Through their actions some of the more fraudulent abuses have been put to a stop, e.g. the de facto illegal television calling games have been banned from television in Flanders.|Jonas Geirnaert|BASTA|('Jonas Geirnaert (', 'the television show BASTA')|(0, 2)|Jonas Geirnaert ( made the television show BASTA
The Belgian Socialist Party (, PSB;, BSP) was a social - democratic political party which existed in Belgium from 1945 to 1978. During its time in office, a number of progressive social reforms were introduced. The BSP was founded by activists from the Belgian Labour Party (1885 – 1940), which was the first Belgian socialist party. It ceased to function during the Second World War, while Belgium was under Nazi occupation. Its main support bases were the co - operative and trade union movements, and it won relatively more support in Wallonia. Like most Belgian political organisations, the party supported greater integration with the European Economic Community, albeit in a socialist context. As linguistic and community issues became more divisive, the Belgian Socialist Party split into two new entities: the Socialistische Partij for the Flemish community and the Parti Socialiste for the Francophone community.|The Belgian Socialist Party|the Parti Socialiste|('The Belgian Socialist Party (,', 'the Parti Socialiste')|(0, 2)|The Belgian Socialist Party split into two new entities: the Socialistische Partij for the Flemish community the Parti Socialiste

Thomas Wolsey (c. March 1473 – 29 November 1530; sometimes spelled Woolsey or Wulcy) was an English churchman, statesman and a cardinal of the Catholic Church. When Henry VIII became King of England in 1509, Wolsey became the King's almoner. Wolsey's affairs prospered, and by 1514 he had become the controlling figure in virtually all matters of state and extremely powerful within the Church, as Archbishop of York, a cleric in England junior only to the Archbishop of Canterbury. His appointment in 1515 as a cardinal by Pope Leo X gave him precedence over all other English clerics. The highest political position Wolsey attained was Lord Chancellor, the King's chief adviser (formally, as his successor and disciple Thomas Cromwell was not). In that position, he enjoyed great freedom and was often depicted as an alter rex (other king). After failing to negotiate an annulment of Henry's marriage to Catherine of Aragon, Wolsey fell out of favour and was stripped of his government titles. He retreated to York to fulfill his ecclesiastical duties as Archbishop of York, a position he nominally held, but had neglected during his years in government. He was recalled to London to answer to charges of treason — a common charge used by Henry against ministers who fell out of favour — but died on the way from natural causes.|Thomas Wolsey politician|Catholic Church country|('Thomas Wolsey politician(', 'the Catholic Church country.')|(0, 1)|Thomas Wolsey politician( spelled was an English churchman, statesman a cardinal of the Catholic Church country.

In 1866, missionaries from the Methodist Episcopal came; Wong Nai Song was baptised and converted to Christianity in November that year. Although it was not to the liking of the villagers, he was not ostracised as they still regard him as from the same clan. As time went by, the villagers also converted to Christianity. In the winter of 1867, priest Xu Yang Mei took Wong Nai Siong as an assistant and taught him the Bible. This led to Wong Nai Siong's learning English and being exposed to Western culture and thinking.

East Midlands Parkway railway station is located north of Ratcliffe - on - Soar on the Midland Main Line in the East Midlands of England. It provides park and ride facilities for rail passengers on the routes from to and. It is also the closest station to East Midlands Airport, some away, which is reached by an hourly minibus service. All train services are operated by East Midlands Trains (EMT). The station lies in southwest Nottinghamshire, about from the border with Leicestershire and from that with Derbyshire, between the stations at, and. When it opened, there was a little - used shuttle bus from the station to the airport, but this ceased not long afterwards. An hourly minibus service was re - introduced in 2015. The main station building and the 850-vehicle car park are to the west of the line, opposite Ratcliffe - on - Soar Power Station. Road access is via the A453, which provides a link to the nearby (three - minute drive) M1 motorway. The Midland Main Line is not electrified north of Bedford; therefore, all services are operated by diesel trains.

Fort Sumter is a sea fort in Charleston, South Carolina, notable for two battles of the American Civil War. It was one of a number of special forts planned after the War of 1812, combining high walls and heavy masonry, and classified as Third System, as a grade of structural integrity. Work started in 1829, but was incomplete by 1860, when South Carolina seceded from the Union. The First Battle of Fort Sumter began on April 12, 1861, when Confederate artillery fired on the Union garrison. These were the first shots of the war and continued all day, watched by many civilians in a celebratory spirit. The fort had been cut off from its supply line and surrendered the next day. The Second Battle of Fort Sumter (September 8, 1863) was a failed attempt by the Union to retake the fort, dogged by a rivalry between army and navy commanders. Although the fort was reduced to rubble, it remained in Confederate hands until it was evacuated as General Sherman marched through South Carolina in February 1865. Fort Sumter is open for public tours as part of the Fort Sumter National Monument operated by the National Park Service.|Fort Sumter National Monument protected area|National Park Service organization|('Fort Sumter National Monument protected area', 'National Park Service organization.')|(8, 11)|Fort Sumter National Monument protected area operated by National Park Service organization.
Pacific Fair is a major shopping centre in Broadbeach Waters on the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. It was Queensland's largest regional shopping centre until 2006. Pacific Fair was developed by Hooker Retail Developments and opened in 1977 on what was swampland with 96 specialty stores and two anchor tenants. Since then, Pacific Fair has undergone numerous expansions and has grown to have more than 300 specialty stores and four anchor tenants. In January 2014, work began on a major redevelopment project to meet the predicted regional growth on the Gold Coast. Prior to the redevelopment, the shopping centre had four main major stores including a four - level Myer, Kmart, Target, Coles and Toys' R' Us. Daimaru operated in the centre before its Australian withdrawal, albeit briefly. It also had a 12-screen Birch Carroll and Coyle Cinema (re - opened as Event Cinemas in late 2015). Pacific Fair is a major public transport interchange on the Gold Coast, serviced by Surfside Buslines, and the Broadbeach South station located not far from the shopping centre. Nearby is The Star Gold Coast and Gold Coast Convention & Exhibition Centre. Pacific Fair fronts Little Tallebudgera Creek and is the southern end of the Surfers Riverwalk.

Charlotte Brontë (,; 21 April 1816   – 31 March 1855) was an English novelist and poet, the eldest of the three Brontë sisters who survived into adulthood and whose novels became classics of English literature. She enlisted in school at Roe Head in January 1831, aged 14 years. She left the year after to teach her sisters, Emily and Anne, at home, returning in 1835 as a governess. In 1839 she undertook the role as governess for the Sidgwick family, but left after a few months to return to Haworth where the sisters opened a school, but failed to attract pupils. Instead they turned to writing and they each first published in 1846 under the pseudonyms of Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell. Her first novel The Professor was rejected by publishers, her second novel Jane Eyre was published in 1847. The sisters admitted to their Bell pseudonyms in 1848, and by the following year were celebrated in London literary circles. Brontë experienced the early deaths of all her siblings. She became pregnant shortly after her marriage in June 1854 but died on 31 March 1855 of tuberculosis or possibly typhus.|Charlotte Brontë|Jane Eyre|('Charlotte Brontë (,;', 'Jane Eyre')|(0, 3)|Writer Charlotte Brontë second novel book Jane Eyre
"The Piano Lesson is a 1987 play by American playwright August Wilson. It is the fourth play in Wilson's The Pittsburgh Cycle. Wilson began writing this play by playing with the various answers regarding the possibility of \""acquir[ing ] a sense of self - worth by denying one's past\"". The Piano Lesson received the 1990 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. A Romare Bearden painting, The Piano Lesson, inspired Wilson to write a play featuring a strong female character to confront African - American history, paralleling Troy in earlier Fences. However, on finishing his play, Wilson found the ending to stray from the empowered female character as well as from the question regarding self - worth. What The Piano Lesson finally seems to ask is: \""What do you do with your legacy, and how do you best put it to use ?\"" Set in 1936 Pittsburgh during the aftermath of the Great Depression, The Piano Lesson follows the lives of the Charles family in the Doaker Charles household and an heirloom, the family piano, which is decorated with designs carved by an enslaved ancestor. The play focuses on the arguments between a brother and a sister who have different ideas on what to do with the piano. The brother, Boy Willie, is a sharecropper who wants to sell the piano to buy the land (Sutter's land) where his ancestors toiled as slaves. The sister, Berniece, remains emphatic about keeping the piano, which shows the carved faces of their great - grandfather's wife and son during the days of their enslavement."|Writer Wilson|series of plays The Pittsburgh Cycle|('Writer Wilson', 'series of plays The Pittsburgh Cycle')|(2, 1)|Writer Wilson's series of plays The Pittsburgh Cycle.
"The Zilch memo was an American government document sent by National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger to President Richard Nixon on January 3, 1972, about the military situation in Laos during the Vietnam War. On the memo, in his own handwriting, Nixon described the decade - long bombing campaign by the United States in Southeast Asia as a ""failure,"" having achieved ""zilch,"" despite public comments to the contrary. Just the day before, January 2, Nixon told CBS News reporter Dan Rather in an interview that the bombing was ""very, very effective."" Previously missing from the Richard Nixon Library, the memo was discovered in the possession of Alexander Butterfield, who served as the Deputy Assistant to President Nixon from 1969 to 1973, by Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward, who subsequently published it in his 2015 book The Last of the President's Men. Despite Nixon's private assessment that the bombing was a ""failure,"" U.S. bombing in Southeast Asia increased in 1972."|Person function National Security Advisor|person Henry Kissinger|('National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger')|(5, 2)|Person function National Security Advisor person Henry Kissinger

Squires joined the Army from his birth city of Louisville, Kentucky in July 1943, and by April 23, 1944 was serving as a private first class in Company A, 30th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division. During a battle on that day, near Padiglione, Italy, he repeatedly braved enemy fire to carry messages, bring up reinforcements, and fight the Germans throughout the night and into the next morning. Squires was killed in action a month later, after having been promoted to Sergeant. He was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor on October 2, 1944. Squires, aged 19 at his death, was buried in Zachary Taylor National Cemetery in his hometown of Louisville, Kentucky. In 2001, a memorial honoring Medal of Honor recipients from Kentucky was dedicated in Louisville. The memorial features a six - foot - tall bronze statue of Squires.|Medal|Kentucky|('Medal', 'Kentucky')|(5, 10)|Medal recipients from Kentucky

Benzoyl peroxide: This is available as an over-the-counter product (such as Clearasil®, Stridex® and PanOxyl®) as a leave-on gel or wash. It targets surface bacteria, which often aggravates acne. Lower concentrations and wash formulations are less irritating to your skin.  Salicylic acid: This is available over the counter for acne as a cleanser or lotion. It helps remove the top layer of damaged skin. Salicylic acid dissolves dead skin cells to prevent your hair follicles from clogging.  Azelaic acid: This is a natural acid found in various grains such as barley, wheat and rye. It kills microorganisms on the skin and reduces swelling.  Retinoids (vitamin A derivatives): Retinol, such as Retin-A®, Tazorac® and Differin®, which is available without a prescription, breaks up blackheads and whiteheads and helps prevent clogged pores, the first signs of acne. Most people are candidates for retinoid therapy. These medications aren’t spot treatments and must be used on the entire area of skin affected by acne to prevent the formation of new pimples. You often need to use these for several months before noticing positive results.  Antibiotics: Topical antibiotics like clindamycin and erythromycin control surface bacteria that aggravate and cause acne. Antibiotics are more effective when combined with benzoyl peroxide.  Dapsone: Dapsone (Aczone®) is a topical gel, which also has antibacterial properties. It treats inflamed acne.  Oral acne medications  Oral acne medications are pills that you take by mouth to clear your acne. Types of oral acne medications could include:|Clearasil®|PanOxyl®|('Clearasil®,', 'PanOxyl®)')|(12, 15)|Clearasil®, Stridex® PanOxyl®)
Antibiotics: Antibiotics treat acne caused by bacteria. Common antibiotics for acne include tetracycline, minocycline and doxycycline. These are best for moderate to severe acne.  Isotretinoin (Amnesteem®, Claravis® and Sotret®): Isotretinoin is an oral retinoid. Isotretinoin shrinks the size of oil glands, which contributes to acne formation.  Contraceptives: The use of certain contraceptives can sometimes help women and people AFAB who have acne. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved several types of birth control pills for treating acne. Some brand names include Estrostep®, Beyaz®, Ortho Tri-Cyclen® and Yaz®. These pills contain a combination of estrogen (the primary AFAB sex hormone) and progesterone (a natural form of steroid that helps regulate menstruation).  Hormone therapy: Hormone therapy is helpful for some people with acne, especially if you experience acne flare-ups during menstruation or irregular periods caused by excess androgen (a hormone). Hormone therapy consists of low-dose estrogen and progesterone (birth control pills) or a medication called spironolactone that blocks the effect of certain hormones at the level of your hair follicles and oil glands.  Additional acne therapies  If topical or oral medications don’t work well for your acne or if you have scars from your acne, a healthcare provider may recommend different types of acne therapies to clear your skin, including:|The U.S. Food and Drug Administration|(FDA|('The U.S. Food and Drug Administration', '(FDA)')|(0, 1)|The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)

The Ministry of Home Security was a British government department established in 1939 to direct national civil defence (primarily tasked with organising air raid precautions) during the Second World War. The Ministry for Home Security was headed by Sir John Anderson the Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security. The Ministry's responsibilities covered all central and regional civil defence organisations (such as air raid wardens, rescue squads, fire services, and the Women ’s Voluntary Service). It was also responsible for giving approval to local ARP schemes, and providing public shelters. The Ministry (run under the auspices of the Home Office) produced hundreds of leaflets that were delivered to the population advising on how to deal with the impending air raids. It also managed propaganda poster campaigns to encourage, amongst other things, the carrying of gas masks and for volunteers to join civil defence groups like the Fire Guards. In October 1940, Sir John Anderson was replaced by Herbert Morrison in a reshuffle precipitated by Neville Chamberlain's resignation due to ill - health.

"Jonas Geirnaert (born July 28, 1982) studied animation at the KASK in Ghent. In May 2004 he won the Short Film Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival with his animated short Flatlife (11 min).

Although Flatlife has no political message, Jonas' previous movie, The All - American Alphabet, clearly has one. On stage in Cannes, Jonas had a message for all Americans: \""Do n't vote Bush\"". At that moment such statements were very popular, however his political preference has to be situated in the extreme - left corner as he is a militant for the marxist party Workers Party of Belgium. In the fall of 2005 Geirnaert made the TV comedy series Neveneffecten for Canvas (public Flemish television) with his fellow comedians Lieven Scheire, Koen De Poorter and Jelle De Beule.

"The Second River, or Watsessing River, in the state of New Jersey in the United States, is the second main tributary of the Passaic River encountered while travelling upstream from its mouth at Newark Bay. From its source in West Orange to the Passaic, it is approximately 5   mi (8   km) long. From West Orange, the Second River passes generally easterly through the towns of Orange and East Orange, where it is joined by Wigwam, Parrow, and Nishuane Brooks, then turns slightly to the north (though still generally easterly), and enters the town of Bloomfield. Here, at Watsessing Park, it is joined by Toney's Brook. After leaving Bloomfield, it enters the town of Belleville (which was, early in its history, also named \""Second River\""), and turns slightly to the south (though still generally easterly).

"The Second River, or Watsessing River, in the state of New Jersey in the United States, is the second main tributary of the Passaic River encountered while travelling upstream from its mouth at Newark Bay. From its source in West Orange to the Passaic, it is approximately 5   mi (8   km) long. From West Orange, the Second River passes generally easterly through the towns of Orange and East Orange, where it is joined by Wigwam, Parrow, and Nishuane Brooks, then turns slightly to the north (though still generally easterly), and enters the town of Bloomfield. Here, at Watsessing Park, it is joined by Toney's Brook. After leaving Bloomfield, it enters the town of Belleville (which was, early in its history, also named \""Second River\""), and turns slightly to the south (though still generally easterly). Soon into Belleville, it forms the border between Belleville and Newark. Finally, it joins the Passaic River, on its way to Newark Bay. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, the Second River supported a sizable industrial complex of mills and factories.

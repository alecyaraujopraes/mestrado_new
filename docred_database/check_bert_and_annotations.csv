"Mimolette is a cheese traditionally produced around the city of Lille, France. In France, it is also known as Boule de Lille after its city of origin, or vieux Hollande for being made after the tradition of Edam cheese. It was originally made by the request of Louis XIV, who – in the context of Jean - Baptiste Colbert's mercantilistic policies – was looking for a native French product to replace the then very popular Edam. To make it distinct from Edam he seasoned it with annatto to give it a sweet and nutty flavor and a distinct orange color. It normally weighs about 2   kg (approximately 4.5 pounds) and is made from cow's milk. Its name comes from the French word mi - mou (feminine mi - molle), meaning \""semi - soft\"". This refers to the softness of the crust when young – with age it becomes harder. It has a grey crust and orangish flesh. The orange color comes from the natural seasoning, annatto, which has a sweet and nutty flavor. The cheese has a similar appearance to a cantaloupe melon. The greyish crust of aged Mimolette is the result of cheese mites intentionally introduced to add flavor by their action on the surface of the cheese. Mimolette can be consumed at different stages of aging. When younger, its taste resembles that of Parmesan. Many appreciate it most when \""extra - old\"" (extra - vieille). At that point, it can become rather hard to chew, and the flesh takes a hazelnut - like flavour. The cheese was known to be a favorite of French President Charles De Gaulle."|('French', 'Charles De Gaulle')|('French,', 'Charles De Gaulle')|(8, 9)|('French', 'Charles De Gaulle')|French President Charles De Gaulle|French is the president of Charles De Gaulle|P6|head of government|head of state|1

"The Zilch memo was an American government document sent by National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger to President Richard Nixon on January 3, 1972, about the military situation in Laos during the Vietnam War. On the memo, in his own handwriting, Nixon described the decade - long bombing campaign by the United States in Southeast Asia as a ""failure,"" having achieved ""zilch,"" despite public comments to the contrary. Just the day before, January 2, Nixon told CBS News reporter Dan Rather in an interview that the bombing was ""very, very effective."" Previously missing from the Richard Nixon Library, the memo was discovered in the possession of Alexander Butterfield, who served as the Deputy Assistant to President Nixon from 1969 to 1973, by Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward, who subsequently published it in his 2015 book The Last of the President's Men.

Militia is an Italian neo - Nazi group founded by Maurizio Boccacci, the former leader of the banned. The group first came to attention in 2008 when Boccacci was prosecuted over anti - semitic and Holocaust denialist graffiti. Further prosecutions in 2010 followed raids against the group, prompted by further anti - semitic graffiti which had been put up in response to statements by political and religious leaders supporting the continued existence of Israel. Among the items seized in the raids were machetes, baseball bats, an Israeli Army uniform, and tools used for painting graffiti. Boccacci and four other members were arrested in December 2011 by the Special Operations Group of the Italian Carabinieri.

"The Piano Lesson is a 1987 play by American playwright August Wilson. It is the fourth play in Wilson's The Pittsburgh Cycle. Wilson began writing this play by playing with the various answers regarding the possibility of \""acquir[ing ] a sense of self - worth by denying one's past\"". The Piano Lesson received the 1990 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. A Romare Bearden painting, The Piano Lesson, inspired Wilson to write a play featuring a strong female character to confront African - American history, paralleling Troy in earlier Fences. However, on finishing his play, Wilson found the ending to stray from the empowered female character as well as from the question regarding self - worth. What The Piano Lesson finally seems to ask is: \""What do you do with your legacy, and how do you best put it to use ?\"" Set in 1936 Pittsburgh during the aftermath of the Great Depression, The Piano Lesson follows the lives of the Charles family in the Doaker Charles household and an heirloom, the family piano, which is decorated with designs carved by an enslaved ancestor. The play focuses on the arguments between a brother and a sister who have different ideas on what to do with the piano. The brother, Boy Willie, is a sharecropper who wants to sell the piano to buy the land (Sutter's land) where his ancestors toiled as slaves. The sister, Berniece, remains emphatic about keeping the piano, which shows the carved faces of their great - grandfather's wife and son during the days of their enslavement."|('Wilson', 'The Pittsburgh Cycle')|('a 1987 play', 'is')|(2, 1)|(' Wilson', 'The Pittsburgh Cycle')|Wilson's The Pittsburgh Cycle.|Wilson live-in The Pittsburgh Cycle|P551|residence|notable work|0
Charlotte Brontë (,; 21 April 1816   – 31 March 1855) was an English novelist and poet, the eldest of the three Brontë sisters who survived into adulthood and whose novels became classics of English literature. She enlisted in school at Roe Head in January 1831, aged 14 years. She left the year after to teach her sisters, Emily and Anne, at home, returning in 1835 as a governess. In 1839 she undertook the role as governess for the Sidgwick family, but left after a few months to return to Haworth where the sisters opened a school, but failed to attract pupils. Instead they turned to writing and they each first published in 1846 under the pseudonyms of Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell. Her first novel The Professor was rejected by publishers, her second novel Jane Eyre was published in 1847. The sisters admitted to their Bell pseudonyms in 1848, and by the following year were celebrated in London literary circles. Brontë experienced the early deaths of all her siblings. She became pregnant shortly after her marriage in June 1854 but died on 31 March 1855 of tuberculosis or possibly typhus.|('Charlotte Brontë', 'Jane Eyre')|('Charlotte Brontë (,;', 'Jane Eyre')|(0, 3)|('', '')|Charlotte Brontë second novel Jane Eyre|Charlotte Brontë follows Jane Eyre|P155|follows|Not found|0

"Goodbyeee, or \""Plan F: Goodbyeee\"", is the sixth and final episode of the British historical sitcom Blackadders fourth series, entitled Blackadder Goes Forth. The episode was first broadcast on BBC1 in the United Kingdom on 2 November 1989, shortly before Armistice Day. Apart from the one - off short film made a decade later, it was the last episode of Blackadder to be produced and transmitted. The episode depicts its main characters' final hours before a British offensive on the Western Front of the First World War, and Captain Blackadder's attempts to escape his fate by feigning madness; after he fails to convince General Melchett, and Field Marshal Haig's advice proves useless, he resigns himself to taking part in the push. Goodbyeee has a darker tone than other episodes in the series, culminating in its acclaimed ending in which the main characters are assumed to die in machine - gun fire. The episode's theme of death ties in with the series' use of gallows humour, its criticism and satire of war, and its depiction of authority figures contentedly sending their subordinates to face the enemy, while unwilling to do so themselves. Richard Curtis and Ben Elton wrote the episode, and further material was provided by cast members. Its final sequence, which shows the main characters going \""over the top\"", uses slow motion, as the programme's creators were unhappy with the result of the scripted ending. The enhanced scene has been described as bold and highly poignant."|('Richard Curtis', 'Goodbyeee')|('Richard Curtis', 'Goodbyeee')|(0, 2)|('', '')|Richard Curtis wrote Goodbyeee|Richard Curtis wrote Goodbyeee|P58|screenwriter|screenwriter|1

"Little Red Rooster (or \""The Red Rooster\"" as it was first titled) is a blues standard credited to arranger and songwriter Willie Dixon. The song was first recorded in 1961 by American blues musician Howlin' Wolf in the Chicago blues style. His vocal and slide guitar playing are key elements of the song. It is rooted in the Delta blues tradition and the theme is derived from folklore. Musical antecedents to \""Little Red Rooster\"" appear in earlier songs by blues artists Charlie Patton and Memphis Minnie. A variety of musicians have interpreted and recorded \""Little Red Rooster\"". Some add new words and instrumentation to mimic the sounds of animals mentioned in the lyrics. American soul music singer Sam Cooke adapted the song using a more uptempo approach and it became a successful single on both the US rhythm and blues and pop record charts in 1963. Concurrently, Dixon and Howlin' Wolf toured the UK with the American Folk Blues Festival and helped popularize Chicago blues with local rock musicians overseas. The Rolling Stones were among the first British rock groups to record modern electric blues songs. In 1964, they recorded \""Little Red Rooster\"" with original member Brian Jones, a key player in the recording. Their rendition, which remains closer to the original arrangement than Cooke's, became a number one record in the UK and continues to be the only blues song to reach the top of the British chart. The Stones frequently performed it on television and in concert and released several live recordings of the song. \""Little Red Rooster\"" continues to be performed and recorded, making it one of Willie Dixon's best - known compositions."|('Little Red Rooster', 'Willie Dixon')|"('""Little Red Rooster"" (', ""songwriter Willie Dixon."")"|(1, 3)|('Little Red Rooster', 'Willie Dixon')|Little Red Rooster is a blues standard credited to arranger songwriter Willie Dixon|Little Red Rooster was composed by Willie Dixon|P86|composer|composer|1

"Nintendo Land features twelve different minigames, each based on an existing Nintendo game franchise such as Mario and The Legend of Zelda, depicted as attractions in the eponymous fictional amusement park. The minigames are designed to demonstrate the concept of Wii U and its Wii U GamePad controller to new players, in the same way the 2006 game Wii Sports demonstrated the Wii and its Wii Remote, utilizing many of the controller's features, including its touchscreen controls and motion - sensing capabilities. Some minigames incorporate the Wii Remote Plus and Nunchuk controllers for alternate control schemes and multiplayer support, which also helps exhibit \""asymmetric gameplay\"", a concept in which certain players have different experiences based on the controller they use. Nintendo Land was mostly liked by critics, and sold 5.19 million copies as of December 2017, making it the fifth highest - selling Wii U game. The ability to download the game was removed from the Nintendo eShop in North America on November 10, 2013, then returned for download on August 26, 2016."|('Nintendo Land', 'Mario')|('an existing Nintendo game franchise', 'Mario')|(9, 11)|('', '')|an existing Nintendo game franchise as Mario|Nintendo Land has as series Mario|P179|series|Not found|0

"The Zilch memo was an American government document sent by National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger to President Richard Nixon on January 3, 1972, about the military situation in Laos during the Vietnam War. On the memo, in his own handwriting, Nixon described the decade - long bombing campaign by the United States in Southeast Asia as a ""failure,"" having achieved ""zilch,"" despite public comments to the contrary. Just the day before, January 2, Nixon told CBS News reporter Dan Rather in an interview that the bombing was ""very, very effective."" Previously missing from the Richard Nixon Library, the memo was discovered in the possession of Alexander Butterfield, who served as the Deputy Assistant to President Nixon from 1969 to 1973, by Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward, who subsequently published it in his 2015 book The Last of the President's Men.

"The Piano Lesson is a 1987 play by American playwright August Wilson. It is the fourth play in Wilson's The Pittsburgh Cycle. Wilson began writing this play by playing with the various answers regarding the possibility of \""acquir[ing ] a sense of self - worth by denying one's past\"". The Piano Lesson received the 1990 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. A Romare Bearden painting, The Piano Lesson, inspired Wilson to write a play featuring a strong female character to confront African - American history, paralleling Troy in earlier Fences. However, on finishing his play, Wilson found the ending to stray from the empowered female character as well as from the question regarding self - worth. What The Piano Lesson finally seems to ask is: \""What do you do with your legacy, and how do you best put it to use ?\"" Set in 1936 Pittsburgh during the aftermath of the Great Depression, The Piano Lesson follows the lives of the Charles family in the Doaker Charles household and an heirloom, the family piano, which is decorated with designs carved by an enslaved ancestor. The play focuses on the arguments between a brother and a sister who have different ideas on what to do with the piano. The brother, Boy Willie, is a sharecropper who wants to sell the piano to buy the land (Sutter's land) where his ancestors toiled as slaves. The sister, Berniece, remains emphatic about keeping the piano, which shows the carved faces of their great - grandfather's wife and son during the days of their enslavement."|('Writer Wilson', 'series of plays The Pittsburgh Cycle')|('Writer Wilson', 'series of plays The Pittsburgh Cycle')|(2, 1)|('', '')|Writer Wilson's series of plays The Pittsburgh Cycle.|Writer Wilson has the characters series of plays The Pittsburgh Cycle|P674|characters|Not found|0
Charlotte Brontë (,; 21 April 1816   – 31 March 1855) was an English novelist and poet, the eldest of the three Brontë sisters who survived into adulthood and whose novels became classics of English literature. She enlisted in school at Roe Head in January 1831, aged 14 years. She left the year after to teach her sisters, Emily and Anne, at home, returning in 1835 as a governess. In 1839 she undertook the role as governess for the Sidgwick family, but left after a few months to return to Haworth where the sisters opened a school, but failed to attract pupils. Instead they turned to writing and they each first published in 1846 under the pseudonyms of Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell. Her first novel The Professor was rejected by publishers, her second novel Jane Eyre was published in 1847. The sisters admitted to their Bell pseudonyms in 1848, and by the following year were celebrated in London literary circles. Brontë experienced the early deaths of all her siblings. She became pregnant shortly after her marriage in June 1854 but died on 31 March 1855 of tuberculosis or possibly typhus.|('Charlotte Brontë', 'Jane Eyre')|('Charlotte Brontë (,;', 'Jane Eyre')|(0, 3)|('', '')|Writer Charlotte Brontë second novel book Jane Eyre|Charlotte Brontë has written Jane Eyre|P58|screenwriter|Not found|0

Fort Sumter is a sea fort in Charleston, South Carolina, notable for two battles of the American Civil War. It was one of a number of special forts planned after the War of 1812, combining high walls and heavy masonry, and classified as Third System, as a grade of structural integrity. Work started in 1829, but was incomplete by 1860, when South Carolina seceded from the Union. The First Battle of Fort Sumter began on April 12, 1861, when Confederate artillery fired on the Union garrison. These were the first shots of the war and continued all day, watched by many civilians in a celebratory spirit. The fort had been cut off from its supply line and surrendered the next day. The Second Battle of Fort Sumter (September 8, 1863) was a failed attempt by the Union to retake the fort, dogged by a rivalry between army and navy commanders. Although the fort was reduced to rubble, it remained in Confederate hands until it was evacuated as General Sherman marched through South Carolina in February 1865.

When it opened, there was a little - used shuttle bus from the station to the airport, but this ceased not long afterwards. An hourly minibus service was re - introduced in 2015. The main station building and the 850-vehicle car park are to the west of the line, opposite Ratcliffe - on - Soar Power Station. Road access is via the A453, which provides a link to the nearby (three - minute drive) M1 motorway. The Midland Main Line is not electrified north of Bedford; therefore, all services are operated by diesel trains. This was set to change by 2019, when a scheme to electrify the remainder of the line had been due to be completed. This, along with increased line speeds, would have meant that the station would have been under 80 minutes from the capital. However, the electrification scheme was put' on hold' in the early summer of 2015.|('East Midlands Parkway railway station', 'East Midlands Trains')|('East Midlands Parkway railway station', 'East Midlands Trains')|(5, 9)|('East Midlands Parkway railway station', 'East Midlands Trains')|East Midlands Parkway railway station operated by East Midlands Trains|East Midlands Parkway railway station is operated by East Midlands Trains|P137|operator|operator|1

Thomas Wolsey (c. March 1473 – 29 November 1530; sometimes spelled Woolsey or Wulcy) was an English churchman, statesman and a cardinal of the Catholic Church. When Henry VIII became King of England in 1509, Wolsey became the King's almoner. Wolsey's affairs prospered, and by 1514 he had become the controlling figure in virtually all matters of state and extremely powerful within the Church, as Archbishop of York, a cleric in England junior only to the Archbishop of Canterbury. His appointment in 1515 as a cardinal by Pope Leo X gave him precedence over all other English clerics. The highest political position Wolsey attained was Lord Chancellor, the King's chief adviser (formally, as his successor and disciple Thomas Cromwell was not). In that position, he enjoyed great freedom and was often depicted as an alter rex (other king). After failing to negotiate an annulment of Henry's marriage to Catherine of Aragon, Wolsey fell out of favour and was stripped of his government titles. He retreated to York to fulfill his ecclesiastical duties as Archbishop of York, a position he nominally held, but had neglected during his years in government. He was recalled to London to answer to charges of treason — a common charge used by Henry against ministers who fell out of favour — but died on the way from natural causes.|('Thomas Wolsey', 'Catholic Church')|('Thomas Wolsey (', 'the Catholic Church.')|(0, 1)|(' Thomas Wolsey', 'Catholic Church')|Thomas Wolsey ( spelled was an English churchman, statesman a cardinal of the Catholic Church.|Thomas Wolsey is a notable work of Catholic Church|P800|notable work|religion|0

The Belgian Socialist Party (, PSB;, BSP) was a social - democratic political party which existed in Belgium from 1945 to 1978. During its time in office, a number of progressive social reforms were introduced. The BSP was founded by activists from the Belgian Labour Party (1885 – 1940), which was the first Belgian socialist party. It ceased to function during the Second World War, while Belgium was under Nazi occupation. Its main support bases were the co - operative and trade union movements, and it won relatively more support in Wallonia. Like most Belgian political organisations, the party supported greater integration with the European Economic Community, albeit in a socialist context. As linguistic and community issues became more divisive, the Belgian Socialist Party split into two new entities: the Socialistische Partij for the Flemish community and the Parti Socialiste for the Francophone community.|('The Belgian Socialist Party', 'the Parti Socialiste')|('The Belgian Socialist Party (,', 'the Parti Socialiste')|(0, 2)|('Belgian Socialist Party', 'Parti Socialiste')|The Belgian Socialist Party split into two new entities: the Socialistische Partij for the Flemish community the Parti Socialiste|The Belgian Socialist Party was replaced by the Parti Socialiste|P1366|replaced by|followed by|0
"Have You Ever Been in Love is a song recorded by Canadian recording artist Celine Dion, included first on her seventh English studio album A New Day Has Come (2002) and later, on her eight English studio album One Heart (2003). The song is a power ballad, written by Anders Bagge, Peer Åström, Tom Nichols, Daryl Hall and Laila Bagge, while production was handled by Bagge & Peer. \""Have You Ever Been in Love\"" builds from a gentle, piano - laced opening into a theatrical, string - framed climax. The song received acclaim from music critics, while being reviewed in both albums. Many critics called it a classic - sounding ballad and one of the strongest cuts from the album.

The Belgian Socialist Party (, PSB;, BSP) was a social - democratic political party which existed in Belgium from 1945 to 1978. During its time in office, a number of progressive social reforms were introduced. The BSP was founded by activists from the Belgian Labour Party (1885 – 1940), which was the first Belgian socialist party. It ceased to function during the Second World War, while Belgium was under Nazi occupation. Its main support bases were the co - operative and trade union movements, and it won relatively more support in Wallonia. Like most Belgian political organisations, the party supported greater integration with the European Economic Community, albeit in a socialist context. As linguistic and community issues became more divisive, the Belgian Socialist Party split into two new entities: the Socialistische Partij for the Flemish community and the Parti Socialiste for the Francophone community.|('The Belgian Socialist Party', 'the Parti Socialiste')|('The Belgian Socialist Party (,', 'the Parti Socialiste')|(0, 2)|('Belgian Socialist Party', 'Parti Socialiste')|The Belgian Socialist Party split into two new entities: the Socialistische Partij for the Flemish community the Parti Socialiste|The Belgian Socialist Party was replaced by the Parti Socialiste|P1366|replaced by|followed by|0

Thomas Wolsey (c. March 1473 – 29 November 1530; sometimes spelled Woolsey or Wulcy) was an English churchman, statesman and a cardinal of the Catholic Church. When Henry VIII became King of England in 1509, Wolsey became the King's almoner. Wolsey's affairs prospered, and by 1514 he had become the controlling figure in virtually all matters of state and extremely powerful within the Church, as Archbishop of York, a cleric in England junior only to the Archbishop of Canterbury. His appointment in 1515 as a cardinal by Pope Leo X gave him precedence over all other English clerics. The highest political position Wolsey attained was Lord Chancellor, the King's chief adviser (formally, as his successor and disciple Thomas Cromwell was not). In that position, he enjoyed great freedom and was often depicted as an alter rex (other king). After failing to negotiate an annulment of Henry's marriage to Catherine of Aragon, Wolsey fell out of favour and was stripped of his government titles. He retreated to York to fulfill his ecclesiastical duties as Archbishop of York, a position he nominally held, but had neglected during his years in government. He was recalled to London to answer to charges of treason — a common charge used by Henry against ministers who fell out of favour — but died on the way from natural causes.|('Thomas Wolsey politician', 'Catholic Church country')|('Thomas Wolsey politician(', 'the Catholic Church country.')|(0, 1)|('Thomas Cromwell', 'Catholic Church')|Thomas Wolsey politician( spelled was an English churchman, statesman a cardinal of the Catholic Church country.|Thomas Wolsey politician is a notable work of Catholic Church country|P800|notable work|religion|0
"Dirty Diana is a song by American artist Michael Jackson. It is the ninth track on Jackson's seventh studio album, Bad. The song was released by Epic Records on April 18, 1988 as the fifth single from the album.

The song's lyrics pertain to groupies. \""Dirty Diana\"" has a moderate tempo and is played in the key of G minor. \""Dirty Diana\"" received mixed reviews from contemporary music critics, but was a commercial success worldwide in 1988, charting at No. 1 on the United States Billboard Hot 100. The song also charted within the top ten in multiple countries, including the United Kingdom, France, Italy, and New Zealand. In 2009, after Jackson's death in June, the song re - entered charts, mainly due to digital download sales.

"Solid Rock is a 1972 album by The Temptations for the Gordy (Motown) label, produced by Norman Whitfield. The LP was the first made primarily without founding members and original lead singers Eddie Kendricks and Paul Williams. Frustrated by conflicts and fights with Temptations Otis Williams and Melvin Franklin, and producer Whitfield's steadfast insistence on producing psychedelic soul for the group when they really wanted to sing ballads, Kendricks had quit the act and negotiated a solo deal with Motown's Tamla label. Paul Williams, on the other hand, had fallen ill due to complications from sickle - cell disease and six years of untreated alcoholism. Physically incapable of performing any longer, Williams followed his doctor's advice and retired from the act, although he remained on the Temptations' payroll as a choreographer until committing suicide on August 17, 1973. Williams's final Temptations recording, \""It's Summer\"", is the only song on Solid Rock that includes his vocals."|('Solid Rock', 'Norman Whitfield')|('Solid Rock', 'Norman Whitfield.')|(6, 9)|('Solid Rock', 'Norman Whitfield')|Solid Rock is a 1972 album produced by Norman Whitfield.|Solid Rock is the record label of Norman Whitfield|P264|record label|producer|0

Thomas Wolsey (c. March 1473 – 29 November 1530; sometimes spelled Woolsey or Wulcy) was an English churchman, statesman and a cardinal of the Catholic Church. When Henry VIII became King of England in 1509, Wolsey became the King's almoner. Wolsey's affairs prospered, and by 1514 he had become the controlling figure in virtually all matters of state and extremely powerful within the Church, as Archbishop of York, a cleric in England junior only to the Archbishop of Canterbury. His appointment in 1515 as a cardinal by Pope Leo X gave him precedence over all other English clerics. The highest political position Wolsey attained was Lord Chancellor, the King's chief adviser (formally, as his successor and disciple Thomas Cromwell was not). In that position, he enjoyed great freedom and was often depicted as an alter rex (other king). After failing to negotiate an annulment of Henry's marriage to Catherine of Aragon, Wolsey fell out of favour and was stripped of his government titles. He retreated to York to fulfill his ecclesiastical duties as Archbishop of York, a position he nominally held, but had neglected during his years in government. He was recalled to London to answer to charges of treason — a common charge used by Henry against ministers who fell out of favour — but died on the way from natural causes.|('Thomas Wolsey politician', 'Catholic Church country')|('Thomas Wolsey politician(', 'the Catholic Church country.')|(0, 1)|('Thomas Cromwell', 'Catholic Church')|Thomas Wolsey politician( spelled was an English churchman, statesman a cardinal of the Catholic Church country.|Thomas Wolsey politician is a notable work of Catholic Church country|P800|notable work|religion|0

"Wong Nai Siong () (1849—1924) as a Chinese revolutionary leader and educator from Minqing county in Fuzhou, Fujian province, China. He served in The Methodist Episcopal Church for many years and participated in the \""Letter to Bus\"" reform, Hundred Days' Reform and also the Xinhai Revolution which resulted in the formation of Republic of China on Taiwan. He also led people from Fujian province to migrate to other countries including Malaysia, especially Sibu, Sarawak. Wong Nai Siong was born in Fuzhou Ming Qing, where his father was a carpenter and his family was very poor. He had to work in the farm and study at the same time to provide for the family. In 1866, missionaries from the Methodist Episcopal came; Wong Nai Song was baptised and converted to Christianity in November that year. Although it was not to the liking of the villagers, he was not ostracised as they still regard him as from the same clan. As time went by, the villagers also converted to Christianity. In the winter of 1867, priest Xu Yang Mei took Wong Nai Siong as an assistant and taught him the Bible. This led to Wong Nai Siong's learning English and being exposed to Western culture and thinking. When asked his reason for converting to Christianity, he explained that he was appalled by the disparity between the teachings of Confucius and the actions of those who professed Confucianism."|('Wong Nai Siong politician', 'The Methodist Episcopal Church')|('Wong Nai Siong () (', 'The Methodist Episcopal Church)')|(0, 1)|('Wong Nai Siong', ' Methodist Episcopal')|Wong Nai Siong politician served in The Methodist Episcopal Church|Wong Nai Siong politician was located in The Methodist Episcopal Church|P276|location|religion|0

East Midlands Parkway railway station is located north of Ratcliffe - on - Soar on the Midland Main Line in the East Midlands of England. It provides park and ride facilities for rail passengers on the routes from to and. It is also the closest station to East Midlands Airport, some away, which is reached by an hourly minibus service. All train services are operated by East Midlands Trains (EMT). The station lies in southwest Nottinghamshire, about from the border with Leicestershire and from that with Derbyshire, between the stations at, and. When it opened, there was a little - used shuttle bus from the station to the airport, but this ceased not long afterwards. An hourly minibus service was re - introduced in 2015. The main station building and the 850-vehicle car park are to the west of the line, opposite Ratcliffe - on - Soar Power Station. Road access is via the A453, which provides a link to the nearby (three - minute drive) M1 motorway. The Midland Main Line is not electrified north of Bedford; therefore, all services are operated by diesel trains. This was set to change by 2019, when a scheme to electrify the remainder of the line had been due to be completed. This, along with increased line speeds, would have meant that the station would have been under 80 minutes from the capital. However, the electrification scheme was put' on hold' in the early summer of 2015.|('East Midlands Parkway railway station', 'East Midlands Trains')|('East Midlands Parkway railway station', 'East Midlands Trains')|(5, 9)|('East Midlands Parkway railway station', 'East Midlands Trains')|East Midlands Parkway railway station operated by East Midlands Trains|East Midlands Parkway railway station is operated by East Midlands Trains|P137|operator|operator|1
Fort Sumter is a sea fort in Charleston, South Carolina, notable for two battles of the American Civil War. It was one of a number of special forts planned after the War of 1812, combining high walls and heavy masonry, and classified as Third System, as a grade of structural integrity. Work started in 1829, but was incomplete by 1860, when South Carolina seceded from the Union. The First Battle of Fort Sumter began on April 12, 1861, when Confederate artillery fired on the Union garrison. These were the first shots of the war and continued all day, watched by many civilians in a celebratory spirit. The fort had been cut off from its supply line and surrendered the next day. The Second Battle of Fort Sumter (September 8, 1863) was a failed attempt by the Union to retake the fort, dogged by a rivalry between army and navy commanders. Although the fort was reduced to rubble, it remained in Confederate hands until it was evacuated as General Sherman marched through South Carolina in February 1865. Fort Sumter is open for public tours as part of the Fort Sumter National Monument operated by the National Park Service.|('Fort Sumter National Monument protected area', 'National Park Service organization')|('Fort Sumter National Monument protected area', 'National Park Service organization.')|(8, 11)|('Fort Sumter National Monument', 'National Park Service')|Fort Sumter National Monument protected area operated by National Park Service organization.|Fort Sumter National Monument protected area wrote National Park Service organization|P58|screenwriter|operator|0

Charlotte Brontë (,; 21 April 1816   – 31 March 1855) was an English novelist and poet, the eldest of the three Brontë sisters who survived into adulthood and whose novels became classics of English literature. She enlisted in school at Roe Head in January 1831, aged 14 years. She left the year after to teach her sisters, Emily and Anne, at home, returning in 1835 as a governess. In 1839 she undertook the role as governess for the Sidgwick family, but left after a few months to return to Haworth where the sisters opened a school, but failed to attract pupils. Instead they turned to writing and they each first published in 1846 under the pseudonyms of Currer, Ellis and Acton Bell. Her first novel The Professor was rejected by publishers, her second novel Jane Eyre was published in 1847. The sisters admitted to their Bell pseudonyms in 1848, and by the following year were celebrated in London literary circles. Brontë experienced the early deaths of all her siblings. She became pregnant shortly after her marriage in June 1854 but died on 31 March 1855 of tuberculosis or possibly typhus.|('Charlotte Brontë', 'Jane Eyre')|('Charlotte Brontë (,;', 'Jane Eyre')|(0, 3)|('', '')|Writer Charlotte Brontë second novel book Jane Eyre|Charlotte Brontë has written Jane Eyre|P58|screenwriter|Not found|0
"The Piano Lesson is a 1987 play by American playwright August Wilson. It is the fourth play in Wilson's The Pittsburgh Cycle. Wilson began writing this play by playing with the various answers regarding the possibility of \""acquir[ing ] a sense of self - worth by denying one's past\"". The Piano Lesson received the 1990 Pulitzer Prize for Drama. A Romare Bearden painting, The Piano Lesson, inspired Wilson to write a play featuring a strong female character to confront African - American history, paralleling Troy in earlier Fences. However, on finishing his play, Wilson found the ending to stray from the empowered female character as well as from the question regarding self - worth. What The Piano Lesson finally seems to ask is: \""What do you do with your legacy, and how do you best put it to use ?\"" Set in 1936 Pittsburgh during the aftermath of the Great Depression, The Piano Lesson follows the lives of the Charles family in the Doaker Charles household and an heirloom, the family piano, which is decorated with designs carved by an enslaved ancestor. The play focuses on the arguments between a brother and a sister who have different ideas on what to do with the piano. The brother, Boy Willie, is a sharecropper who wants to sell the piano to buy the land (Sutter's land) where his ancestors toiled as slaves. The sister, Berniece, remains emphatic about keeping the piano, which shows the carved faces of their great - grandfather's wife and son during the days of their enslavement."|('Writer Wilson', 'series of plays The Pittsburgh Cycle')|('Writer Wilson', 'series of plays The Pittsburgh Cycle')|(2, 1)|('', '')|Writer Wilson's series of plays The Pittsburgh Cycle.|Writer Wilson has the characters series of plays The Pittsburgh Cycle|P674|characters|Not found|0
"The Zilch memo was an American government document sent by National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger to President Richard Nixon on January 3, 1972, about the military situation in Laos during the Vietnam War. On the memo, in his own handwriting, Nixon described the decade - long bombing campaign by the United States in Southeast Asia as a ""failure,"" having achieved ""zilch,"" despite public comments to the contrary. Just the day before, January 2, Nixon told CBS News reporter Dan Rather in an interview that the bombing was ""very, very effective."" Previously missing from the Richard Nixon Library, the memo was discovered in the possession of Alexander Butterfield, who served as the Deputy Assistant to President Nixon from 1969 to 1973, by Washington Post reporter Bob Woodward, who subsequently published it in his 2015 book The Last of the President's Men.

The PocketStation is a Memory Card peripheral by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation home video game console. Categorized by Sony as a combination of a Memory Card and a miniature personal digital assistant, the device features a monochrome liquid crystal display (LCD), infrared communication capability, a real - time clock, built - in flash memory, and sound capability. To use the device's memory card functionality, it must be connected to a PlayStation through a memory card slot. It was released exclusively in Japan on January 23, 1999. Software for the PocketStation was typically distributed as extras for PlayStation games, included in the CD - ROM, enhancing the games with added features. Stand - alone software could also be downloaded through the PlayStation console. The software is then transferred to the PocketStation for use. A built - in infrared data interface allows direct transfer of data such as game saves between PocketStation units, as well as multiplayer gaming. The original Japanese ship date for the PocketStation was set for December 23, 1998, but it was delayed a full month. Sony only shipped an initial 60,000 units of the peripheral when it was released on January 23, 1999. It was initially available in two case colors: white and clear. It proved extremely popular, selling out all over the region. Sony planned to release the PocketStation outside Japan, engaging in promotional activity in Europe and North America, but the release did not occur. SCEA cited an inability meeting Japanese demand as the reason for the PocketStation's absence. Despite this, a few games, such as Final Fantasy VIII and SaGa Frontier 2, retained PocketStation functionality in their localized versions. The PocketStation's most popular game was Dokodemo Issho, which sold over 1.5 million copies in Japan and is the first game to star Sony's mascot Toro. The PocketStation was discontinued in July 2002 after having shipped nearly five million units. On November 5, 2013, it was announced that the PocketStation would be revived as an application for the PlayStation Vita, allowing users to play PocketStation format minigames for any classic PlayStation games that they own. Originally it was only available to PlayStation Plus members, it was later released to the general public. It remains an exclusive to the Japanese PlayStation Vitas. The PocketStation also shares similarities with Sega's VMU for the Dreamcast.|('PocketStation', 'Sony Computer Entertainment')|('The PocketStation', 'Sony Computer Entertainment')|(0, 0)|('PocketStation', 'Sony Computer Entertainment')|The PocketStation is peripheral by Sony Computer Entertainment|PocketStation has as series Sony Computer Entertainment|P179|series|publisher|0

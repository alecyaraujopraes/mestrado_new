You’ll usually get pimples on your face. Clogged pores cause acne. Teenagers and young adults most often get acne, but it can also occur during adulthood for many people. Treatment is available to clear acne from your skin and prevent scarring.  Contents Overview Symptoms and Causes Diagnosis and Tests Management and Treatment Prevention Outlook / Prognosis Living With Contents Overview Symptoms and Causes Diagnosis and Tests Management and Treatment Prevention Outlook / Prognosis Living With Overview What is acne? Acne is a common skin condition where the pores of your skin clog. Pore blockages produce blackheads, whiteheads and other types of pimples. Pimples are pus-filled, sometimes painful, bumps on your skin.  The medical term for acne is acne vulgaris.  What are the types of acne? There are several types of acne, including:  Fungal acne (pityrosporum folliculitis): Fungal acne occurs when yeast builds up in your hair follicles. These can be itchy and inflamed. Cystic acne: Cystic acne causes deep, pus-filled pimples and nodules. These can cause scars. Hormonal acne: Hormonal acne affects adults who have an overproduction of sebum that clogs their pores. Nodular acne: Nodular acne is a severe form of acne that causes pimples on the surface of your skin, and tender, nodular lumps under your skin. All of these forms of acne can affect your self-esteem, and both cystic and nodular acne can lead to permanent skin damage in the form of scarring. It’s best to seek help from a healthcare provider early so they can determine the best treatment option(s) for you.  Who does acne affect? Acne usually affects everyone at some point in their lifetime. It’s most common among teenagers and young adults undergoing hormonal changes, but acne can also occur during adulthood. Adult acne is more common among women and people assigned female at birth (AFAB). You may be more at risk of developing acne if you have a family history of acne (genetics).  How common is acne? If you have acne, know that you’re not alone. Acne is the most common skin condition that people experience. An estimated 80% of people ages 11 to 30 will have at least a mild form of acne.  Where on my body will I have acne? The most common places where you might have acne are on your:  Face. Forehead. Chest. Shoulders. Upper back. Oil glands exist all over your body. The common locations of acne are where oil glands exist the most.  Symptoms and Causes What are the symptoms of acne? Symptoms of acne on your skin include:  Pimples (pustules): Pus-filled bumps (papules). Papules: Small, discolored bumps, often red to purple or darker than your natural skin tone. Blackheads: Plugged pores with a black top. Whiteheads: Plugged pores with a white top. Nodules: Large lumps under your skin that are painful. Cysts: Painful fluid-filled (pus) lumps under your skin. Acne can be mild and cause a few occasional pimples or it can be moderate and cause inflammatory papules. Severe acne causes nodules and cysts.  What causes acne? Clogged hair follicles or pores cause acne. Your hair follicles are small tubes that hold a strand of your hair. There are several glands that empty into your hair follicles. When too much material is inside your hair follicle, a clog occurs. Your pores can clog with:  Sebum: An oily substance that provides a protective barrier for your skin. Bacteria: Small amounts of bacteria naturally live on your skin. If you have too much bacteria, it can clog your pores. Dead skin cells: Your skin cells shed often to make room for more cells to grow. When your skin releases dead skin cells, they can get stuck in your hair follicles. When your pores clog, substances plug up your hair follicle, creating a pimple. This triggers inflammation, which you feel as pain and swelling. You can also see inflammation through skin discoloration like redness around a pimple.  Triggers of acne Certain things in your environment contribute to acne or they can make an acne breakout worse, including:  Wearing tight-fitting clothing and headgear, like hats and sports helmets. Air pollution and certain weather conditions, especially high humidity. Using oily or greasy personal care products, like heavy lotions and creams, or working in an area where you routinely come in contact with grease, such as working at a restaurant with frying oil. Stress, which increases the hormone cortisol. A side effect of a medication. Picking at your acne. Foods that cause acne Some studies link particular foods and diets to acne, like:  Skim milk. Whey protein. Diets high in sugar. While high-sugar diets may lead to acne outbreaks, chocolate isn’t directly linked to acne.  To reduce your risk of acne, choose to eat a balanced, nutritious diet with plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, especially those rich in vitamin C and beta-carotene, which helps reduce inflammation.  Hormones and acne Acne is largely a hormonal condition that’s driven by androgen hormones (testosterone). This typically becomes active during teenage and young adult years. You might also notice acne forming around the time of your period as a result of hormone activity. Sensitivity to this hormone — combined with surface bacteria on your skin and substances released from your body’s glands — can result in acne.  Diagnosis and Tests How is acne diagnosed? A healthcare provider can diagnose acne during a skin exam. During this exam, the provider will closely look at your skin to learn more about your symptoms. In addition, they may also ask about risk factors for acne, like:  Are you feeling stressed? Do you have a family history of acne? If a woman or person AFAB, do you notice breakouts during your menstrual cycle? What medications do you currently take? Your healthcare provider won’t need to run any diagnostic tests for acne, but they may offer tests to diagnose any underlying conditions if you have sudden, severe acne outbreaks, especially if you’re an adult.  Who treats acne? A general healthcare provider or a dermatologist can diagnose and treat acne. If you have stubborn acne that doesn’t improve with treatment, a dermatologist can help.  How severe can acne get? Dermatologists rank acne by severity:  Grade 1 (mild): Mostly whiteheads and blackheads, with a few papules and pustules. Grade 2 (moderate or pustular acne): Multiple papules and pustules, mostly on your face. Grade 3 (moderately severe or nodulocystic acne): Numerous papules and pustules, along with occasionally inflamed nodules. Your back and chest may also be affected. Grade 4 (severe nodulocystic acne): Numerous large, painful and inflamed pustules and nodules. Management and Treatment How is acne treated? There are several ways to treat acne. Each type of treatment varies based on your age, the type of acne you have and the severity. A healthcare provider might recommend taking oral medications, using topical medications or using medicated therapies to treat your skin. The goal of acne treatment is to stop new pimples from forming and to heal the existing blemishes on your skin.  Topical acne medications Your healthcare provider may recommend using a topical acne medication to treat your skin. You can rub these medications directly onto your skin as you would a lotion or a moisturizer. These could include products that contain one of the following ingredients:  Benzoyl peroxide: This is available as an over-the-counter product (such as Clearasil®, Stridex® and PanOxyl®) as a leave-on gel or wash. It targets surface bacteria, which often aggravates acne. Lower concentrations and wash formulations are less irritating to your skin. Salicylic acid: This is available over the counter for acne as a cleanser or lotion. It helps remove the top layer of damaged skin. Salicylic acid dissolves dead skin cells to prevent your hair follicles from clogging. Azelaic acid: This is a natural acid found in various grains such as barley, wheat and rye. It kills microorganisms on the skin and reduces swelling. Retinoids (vitamin A derivatives): Retinol, such as Retin-A®, Tazorac® and Differin®, which is available without a prescription, breaks up blackheads and whiteheads and helps prevent clogged pores, the first signs of acne. Most people are candidates for retinoid therapy. These medications aren’t spot treatments and must be used on the entire area of skin affected by acne to prevent the formation of new pimples. You often need to use these for several months before noticing positive results. Antibiotics: Topical antibiotics like clindamycin and erythromycin control surface bacteria that aggravate and cause acne. Antibiotics are more effective when combined with benzoyl peroxide. Dapsone: Dapsone (Aczone®) is a topical gel, which also has antibacterial properties. It treats inflamed acne. Oral acne medications Oral acne medications are pills that you take by mouth to clear your acne. Types of oral acne medications could include:  Antibiotics: Antibiotics treat acne caused by bacteria. Common antibiotics for acne include tetracycline, minocycline and doxycycline. These are best for moderate to severe acne. Isotretinoin (Amnesteem®, Claravis® and Sotret®): Isotretinoin is an oral retinoid. Isotretinoin shrinks the size of oil glands, which contributes to acne formation. Contraceptives: The use of certain contraceptives can sometimes help women and people AFAB who have acne. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved several types of birth control pills for treating acne. Some brand names include Estrostep®, Beyaz®, Ortho Tri-Cyclen® and Yaz®. These pills contain a combination of estrogen (the primary AFAB sex hormone) and progesterone (a natural form of steroid that helps regulate menstruation). Hormone therapy: Hormone therapy is helpful for some people with acne, especially if you experience acne flare-ups during menstruation or irregular periods caused by excess androgen (a hormone). Hormone therapy consists of low-dose estrogen and progesterone (birth control pills) or a medication called spironolactone that blocks the effect of certain hormones at the level of your hair follicles and oil glands. Additional acne therapies If topical or oral medications don’t work well for your acne or if you have scars from your acne, a healthcare provider may recommend different types of acne therapies to clear your skin, including:  Steroids: Steroids can treat severe acne with injections into large nodules to reduce inflammation. Lasers: Lasers and light therapy treat acne scars. A laser delivers heat to the scarred collagen under your skin. This relies on your body’s wound-healing response to create new, healthy collagen, which encourages growth of new skin to replace it. Chemical peels: This treatment uses special chemicals to remove the top layer of old skin. After removal of the top layer of skin, new skin grows in smoother and can lessen acne scars. How do antibiotics treat acne? Antibiotics are medications that target bacteria. Some used to treat acne also can decrease inflammation. Bacteria can clog your pores and cause acne. Antibiotics are responsible for:  Blocking bacteria from entering your body. Destroying bacteria. Preventing bacteria from multiplying. A healthcare provider will recommend antibiotics if you have acne caused by bacteria or if you have an infection. Antibiotics get rid of an infection if bacteria gets into a popped pimple, which can swell and become painful. This medication isn’t a cure for acne and you shouldn’t take it long-term to treat acne.  How can I make my acne go away at home? If you have acne, you can start an at-home skin care routine to help your acne go away by:  Washing your skin at least once daily with warm (not hot) water and a gentle cleanser. Cleansers are over-the-counter skin care products that help clean your skin. Washing your skin after you exercise or sweat. Avoid using skin care products with alcohol, astringents, toners and exfoliants, which can irritate your skin. Removing your makeup at the end of the day or before you go to bed. Choosing an oil-free moisturizer to apply on your skin after cleansing. Avoid popping, picking or squeezing your acne. Let your skin heal naturally to prevent scars from forming on your skin. If your at-home skin care routine isn’t effective at treating acne, visit a healthcare provider.  Is acne treatment safe for people who are pregnant? Many topical and oral acne treatments aren’t safe to take during pregnancy. If you’re pregnant or planning on becoming pregnant, it’s important to discuss acne treatments with your healthcare provider and notify them if you become pregnant.  How long does it take for acne to go away? On average, it can take between one to two weeks for acne pimples to clear up on their own. With medicated treatment and a good skin care routine, you can speed up your body’s healing time to make acne go away faster. For severe acne, it can take several weeks for your acne to go away, even with treatment.  Prevention How can I prevent acne? You can’t completely prevent acne, especially during hormone changes, but you can reduce your risk of developing acne by:  Washing your face daily with warm water and a facial cleanser. Using an oil-free moisturizer. Wearing “noncomedogenic” makeup products and removing makeup at the end of each day. Keeping your hands away from your face. Outlook / Prognosis What can I expect if I have acne? Acne often goes away in early adulthood, though some people will continue to experience acne throughout adulthood. Your healthcare provider or a board-certified dermatologist can help you manage this condition. Various medications and therapies are effective forms of treatment. They target the underlying factors that contribute to acne. It may take several different types of treatment before you and your healthcare provider find one that works best for your skin. The skin care products that work for you might not work for someone else with similar symptoms.  Can acne cause scars? Yes, sometimes acne can cause scarring. This happens when the acne penetrates the top layer of your skin and damages deeper skin layers. Inflammation makes your acne pores swell and the pore walls start to breakdown, which causes skin damage. Scarring can be a source of anxiety, which is normal. Before treatment, your healthcare provider will determine what type of acne caused your scars. There are several treatment options available for acne scars.  How does acne affect my mental health? Acne can cause disruptions in your mental health because it affects your appearance and self-esteem. Often, acne development is out of your control if hormones cause it. This can create stress, which can influence future breakouts. Acne can be challenging for teenagers and young adults. If your acne causes you to feel anxious or it prevents you from participating in social activities with your friends and family, talk to a healthcare provider or a mental health professional.  Living With When should I see my healthcare provider? Visit a healthcare provider as soon as you notice pimples so you can start treatment immediately before scarring occurs. If you’re using an acne treatment that isn’t working to clear your acne or it causes skin irritation like itchiness or skin discoloration, visit a provider.  What questions should I ask my doctor? What type of acne do I have? How severe is my acne? Do I need to see a dermatologist? What over-the-counter medications do you recommend? What prescription medications do you recommend? A note from Cleveland Clinic  Acne is the most common of all skin conditions and it can have an impact on your mental health and self-esteem. If you have stubborn acne, visit a healthcare provider or a dermatologist to treat your acne. Sometimes, your acne needs a little extra help to go away with a medication if at-home skin care treatments don’t work. While it may be tempting, try not to pick at your acne or pop pimples to prevent scarring. Remember that acne is temporary and will go away with the right treatment designed for your skin."

It causes whiteheads, blackheads or pimples. Acne is most common among teenagers, though it affects people of all ages.  Effective acne treatments are available, but acne can be persistent. The pimples and bumps heal slowly, and when one begins to go away, others seem to crop up.  Depending on its severity, acne can cause emotional distress and scar the skin. The earlier you start treatment, the lower your risk of such problems.

When to see a doctor If self-care remedies don't clear your acne, see your primary care doctor. He or she can prescribe stronger medications. If acne persists or is severe, you may want to seek medical treatment from a doctor who specializes in the skin (dermatologist or pediatric dermatologist).  For many women, acne can persist for decades, with flares common a week before menstruation. This type of acne tends to clear up without treatment in women who use contraceptives.  In older adults, a sudden onset of severe acne may signal an underlying disease requiring medical attention.  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) warns that some popular nonprescription acne lotions, cleansers and other skin products can cause a serious reaction. This type of reaction is quite rare, so don't confuse it with any redness, irritation or itchiness that occurs in areas where you've applied medications or products.

Causes How acne develops How acne develops Enlarge image Four main factors cause acne:  Excess oil (sebum) production Hair follicles clogged by oil and dead skin cells Bacteria Inflammation Acne typically appears on your face, forehead, chest, upper back and shoulders because these areas of skin have the most oil (sebaceous) glands. Hair follicles are connected to oil glands.  The follicle wall may bulge and produce a whitehead. Or the plug may be open to the surface and darken, causing a blackhead. A blackhead may look like dirt stuck in pores. But actually the pore is congested with bacteria and oil, which turns brown when it's exposed to the air.  Pimples are raised red spots with a white center that develop when blocked hair follicles become inflamed or infected with bacteria. Blockages and inflammation deep inside hair follicles produce cystlike lumps beneath the surface of your skin. Other pores in your skin, which are the openings of the sweat glands, aren't usually involved in acne.  Certain things may trigger or worsen acne:  Hormonal changes. Androgens are hormones that increase in boys and girls during puberty and cause the sebaceous glands to enlarge and make more sebum. Hormone changes during midlife, particularly in women, can lead to breakouts too. Certain medications. Examples include drugs containing corticosteroids, testosterone or lithium. Diet. Studies indicate that consuming certain foods — including carbohydrate-rich foods, such as bread, bagels and chips — may worsen acne. Further study is needed to examine whether people with acne would benefit from following specific dietary restrictions. Stress. Stress doesn't cause acne, but if you have acne already, stress may make it worse. Acne myths These factors have little effect on acne:  Chocolate and greasy foods. Eating chocolate or greasy food has little to no effect on acne. Hygiene. Acne isn't caused by dirty skin. In fact, scrubbing the skin too hard or cleansing with harsh soaps or chemicals irritates the skin and can make acne worse. Cosmetics. Cosmetics don't necessarily worsen acne, especially if you use oil-free makeup that doesn't clog pores (noncomedogenics) and remove makeup regularly. Nonoily cosmetics don't interfere with the effectiveness of acne drugs. Complications People with darker skin types are more likely than are people with lighter skin to experience these acne complications:  Scars. Pitted skin (acne scars) and thick scars (keloids) can remain long-term after acne has healed. Skin changes. After acne has cleared, the affected skin may be darker (hyperpigmented) or lighter (hypopigmented) than before the condition occurred. Risk factors Risk factors for acne include:  Age. People of all ages can get acne, but it's most common in teenagers. Hormonal changes. Such changes are common during puberty or pregnancy. Family history. Genetics plays a role in acne. If both of your parents had acne, you're likely to develop it too. Greasy or oily substances. You may develop acne where your skin comes into contact with oil or oily lotions and creams. Friction or pressure on your skin. This can be caused by items such as telephones, cellphones, helmets, tight collars and backpacks." 
python3 medical_database/SpacyParse.py -s "https://www.niams.nih.gov/health-topics/acne  Overview of Acne Acne is a common skin condition that happens when hair follicles under the skin become clogged. Sebum—oil that helps keep skin from drying out—and dead skin cells plug the pores, which leads to outbreaks of lesions, commonly called pimples or zits. Most often, the outbreaks occur on the face but can also appear on the back, chest, and shoulders.  Acne is an inflammatory disorder of the skin, which has sebaceous (oil) glands that connects to the hair follicle, which contains a fine hair. In healthy skin, the sebaceous glands make sebum that empties onto the skin surface through the pore, which is an opening in the follicle. Keratinocytes, a type of skin cell, line the follicle.  Normally as the body sheds skin cells, the keratinocytes rise to the surface of the skin. When someone has acne, the hair, sebum, and keratinocytes stick together inside the pore. This prevents the keratinocytes from shedding and keeps the sebum from reaching the surface of the skin. The mixture of oil and cells allows bacteria that normally live on the skin to grow in the plugged follicles and cause inflammation—swelling, redness, heat, and pain. When the wall of the plugged follicle breaks down, it spills the bacteria, skin cells, and sebum into nearby skin, creating lesions or pimples.  For most people, acne tends to go away by the time they reach their thirties, but some people in their forties and fifties continue to have this skin problem.  Who Gets Acne? People of all races and ages get acne, but it is most common in teens and young adults. When acne appears during the teenage years, it is more common in males. Acne can continue into adulthood, and when it does, it is more common in women.  Types of Acne Acne causes several types of lesions, or pimples. Doctors refer to enlarged or plugged hair follicles as comedones. Types of acne include:  Whiteheads: Plugged hair follicles that stay beneath the skin and produce a white bump. Blackheads: Plugged follicles that reach the surface of the skin and open up. They look black on the skin surface because the air discolors the sebum, not because they are dirty. Papules: Inflamed lesions that usually appear as small, pink bumps on the skin and can be tender to the touch. Pustules or pimples: Papules topped by white or yellow pus-filled lesions that may be red at the base. Nodules: Large, painful solid lesions that are lodged deep within the skin. Severe nodular acne (sometimes called cystic acne): Deep, painful, pus-filled lesions. Causes of Acne Doctors and researchers believe that one or more of the following can lead to the development of acne:  Excess or high production of oil in the pore. Buildup of dead skin cells in the pore. Growth of bacteria in the pore. The following factors may increase your risk for developing acne:  Hormones. An increase in androgens, which are male sex hormones, may lead to acne. These increase in both boys and girls normally during puberty and cause the sebaceous glands to enlarge and make more sebum. Hormonal changes related to pregnancy can also cause acne.  Family history. Researchers believe that you may be more likely to get acne if your parents had acne. Medications. Certain medications, such as medications that contain hormones, corticosteroids, and lithium, can cause acne. Age. People of all ages can get acne, but it is more common in teens.  The following do not cause acne, but may make it worse.  Diet. Some studies show that eating certain foods may make acne worse. Researchers are continuing to study the role of diet as a cause of acne. Stress. Pressure from sports helmets, tight clothes, or backpacks. Environmental irritants, such as pollution and high humidity. Squeezing or picking at blemishes. Scrubbing your skin too hard." 
python3 medical_database/SpacyParse.py -s " Acromegaly Acromegaly is a rare but serious medical condition that happens when you have too much growth hormone in your body. Acromegaly affects your body’s bones and tissues and causes them to grow in irregular ways. The most common treatments for acromegaly include surgery, medication and radiation therapy.  Contents Overview Symptoms and Causes Diagnosis and Tests Management and Treatment Prevention Outlook / Prognosis Living With Contents Overview Symptoms and Causes Diagnosis and Tests Management and Treatment Prevention Outlook / Prognosis Living With Overview What is acromegaly? Acromegaly (pronounced a-krow-meh-guh-lee) is a rare but serious medical condition that happens when you have high levels of growth hormone (GH) in your body. Your pituitary gland normally produces GH, but tumors on your pituitary or in other parts of your body produce excess GH in acromegaly.  Your pituitary gland is a small, pea-sized endocrine gland located at the base of your brain below your hypothalamus. Your pituitary gland releases eight important hormones, including GH.  Growth hormone, also known as human growth hormone (hGH) and somatotropin, is a natural hormone that acts on many parts of the body to promote growth in children. Once the growth plates (epiphyses) in your bones have fused, GH no longer increases height, but your body still needs GH. After you’ve finished growing, GH helps to maintain normal bone, cartilage and organ structure and metabolism, including helping to keep your blood glucose (sugar) levels within a healthy range.  If you have too much GH in your body as an adult, it can result in irregularly-shaped bones, increased organ size, elevated blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) and other symptoms.  What is the difference between acromegaly and gigantism? Acromegaly and gigantism are both conditions that result from excess growth hormone (GH). The difference is in who the conditions affect — adults develop acromegaly, whereas children develop gigantism.  In children, gigantism occurs when they experience excess GH before the growth plates in their bones fuse (before the end of puberty). This causes them to grow very tall. Gigantism is more rare than acromegaly. Some healthcare providers refer to gigantism as pediatric acromegaly.  Once your growth plates have fused, excess GH causes acromegaly. In this case, you don’t grow in height, but the excess GH affects your bones’ shape and your organ size as well as other health factors.  Who does acromegaly affect? Acromegaly can develop at any age after puberty, but healthcare providers most often diagnose it during the fourth and fifth decades of life (middle age).  How common is acromegaly? Acromegaly is rare. Approximately 3 to 14 of every 100,000 people have been diagnosed with acromegaly.  How does acromegaly affect my body? In adults, acromegaly (excess growth hormone) causes bones, cartilage, body organs and other tissues to increase in size. Characteristic changes in appearance include larger hands, feet, ears, lips and nose and a more prominent jaw and forehead.  Growth hormone (GH) signals your liver to produce another hormone called insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). IGF-1 is the hormone that actually causes your bones and body tissue to grow and also affects how your body processes blood glucose (sugar) and lipids (fats). High levels of GH result in high levels of IFG-1, which can lead to Type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure (hypertension) and heart disease.  Symptoms and Causes Pituitary gland with a pituitary adenoma on it and a man with a prominent chin and jaw and large hands. The most common cause of acromegaly is a pituitary adenoma (tumor) that causes your pituitary gland to release excess growth hormone (GH), which causes certain symptoms. What causes acromegaly? The most common cause of acromegaly is a tumor in your pituitary gland called a pituitary adenoma that causes your pituitary gland to release excess growth hormone (GH).  Pituitary adenomas and acromegaly Pituitary adenomas (tumors) are almost always benign (noncancerous). Most adenomas that cause acromegaly grow slowly, and you may not notice symptoms of excess GH for many years.  Depending on its size and location, the adenoma may press against other pituitary tissue and affect other hormones your pituitary gland makes. If the adenoma is large, it may also press against nearby parts of your brain, causing headaches and vision problems.  What are the symptoms of acromegaly? In adults, acromegaly affects your body’s bones and tissues and causes them to grow in irregular ways.  Adults with acromegaly may experience the following symptoms:  Enlarged hands or feet. Changes in your face shape, including a more prominent jaw and/or forehead. Increase in size of your lips, nose and/or tongue. Excessive sweating or oily skin. Deepening of your voice. Other symptoms include:  Headaches. Joint pain. Vision changes. Increase in the number of skin tags. Numbness in your hands. Sleep apnea. Carpal tunnel syndrome or spinal cord issues. Acromegaly symptoms often start slowly and may be difficult to notice at first. Some people only notice their hands have grown in size when rings they regularly wear feel tight or their shoe size changes, especially the width.  If you’re experiencing these symptoms, it’s important to talk to your healthcare provider.  Diagnosis and Tests How is acromegaly diagnosed? Symptoms of acromegaly often show up very slowly over many years. This makes it hard to diagnose.  Your healthcare provider may recommend you see an endocrinologist, a healthcare provider who specializes in hormone-related conditions. They'll make a diagnosis based on your medical history, a thorough clinical evaluation and specialized tests like blood tests and imaging tests.  What tests will be done to diagnose acromegaly? If you’ve been diagnosed with acromegaly, your provider may order additional tests to see if the condition has affected other parts of your body. These tests may include:  An echocardiogram to check for heart issues. Sleep study tests to check for sleep apnea. A colonoscopy to assess the health of your colon. X-rays or a DEXA (DXA) scan to check bone health. Management and Treatment How is acromegaly treated? There are several treatment options for acromegaly. Your healthcare provider will consider your symptoms and circumstances before offering treatment options that are right for you.  The most common treatments for acromegaly are surgery, medication and radiation therapy.  Surgery for acromegaly In many cases, surgery greatly improves acromegaly symptoms or corrects the condition entirely. Surgeons most often use a type of surgery called transsphenoidal surgery, which involves going through your nose and sphenoid sinus, a hollow space in your skull behind the nasal passages and below your brain, to perform surgery.  The specifics of the surgery will depend on the size and location of the tumor. The goal of surgery is to remove all of a tumor that is causing excess growth hormone production. If your surgeon removes enough of the tumor, you may not need further treatment. If your surgeon can remove only a part of a tumor, you may need medication or radiation therapy to manage your symptoms and reduce the production of growth hormone.  https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/17743-acromegaly  Medications for acromegaly Your healthcare provider may prescribe one medication or a combination of medications. Medications work in different ways to normalize your body’s growth hormone levels and improve your symptoms. In some cases, a person may take medication until the tumor has shrunk. This can allow a surgeon to then safely remove it. Other people may need to take medication long-term to effectively manage growth hormone levels and symptoms.  Is acromegaly curable? Acromegaly is curable in some situations but not all. The cure rate for surgical removal of a pituitary tumor that’s causing acromegaly is about 85% for small tumors and 40% to 50% percent for large tumors.  Medication can’t cure acromegaly but offers long-term, safe treatment.  Prevention Can I prevent acromegaly? Unfortunately, there’s nothing you can do to prevent acromegaly. Scientists aren’t sure what causes pituitary tumors that cause acromegaly to develop, though they think certain genetic factors may play a role.  Outlook / Prognosis What is the prognosis (outlook) for acromegaly? The prognosis (outlook) for acromegaly depends on how severe it is and how effectively therapies treat the symptoms. Many people with acromegaly see a significant improvement in symptoms after treatment.  If it’s not treated, acromegaly can significantly change your appearance and the shape of your bones. These symptoms can greatly affect your self-image and quality of life. Support groups help some people cope with the challenges they face because of acromegaly.  Health complications of acromegaly such as heart disease or Type 2 diabetes can also decrease quality of life and even shorten your lifespan. Because of this, it’s important to contact your healthcare provider if you’re experiencing symptoms and to adhere to your treatment plan if you’ve been diagnosed.  What are the complications of acromegaly? If left untreated, acromegaly can cause the following complications:  Type 2 diabetes. High blood pressure (hypertension). Heart disease. Cardiomyopathy (disease of your heart muscle). Arthritis. Colon polyps, which can potentially turn into colon cancer if left untreated. Organ failure. What is the life expectancy of someone with acromegaly? Life expectancy for someone with acromegaly depends on the severity of the condition and if they have other health conditions, usually due to untreated acromegaly.  If your growth hormone levels aren’t properly managed and you have other conditions like heart disease and Type 2 diabetes, your life expectancy may reduce by approximately 10 years.  If you have acromegaly that’s properly treated and have normal growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels, you’ll likely have a normal life expectancy.  Living With When should I see my healthcare provider about acromegaly? If you’re experiencing symptoms of acromegaly, it’s important to talk to your healthcare provider.  If you’ve been diagnosed with acromegaly, you’ll need to see your provider regularly to make sure your treatment is working well.  A note from Cleveland Clinic  Acromegaly is a rare but serious condition. The good news is that it’s treatable with surgery, medication and/or radiation therapy. If you’ve noticed an increase in size in your hands, feet and/or facial features, it’s important to talk to your healthcare provider. They can order some simple tests to see if your growth hormone levels are the cause of your symptoms."

When you have too much growth hormone, your bones increase in size. In childhood, this leads to increased height and is called gigantism. But in adulthood, a change in height doesn't occur. Instead, the increase in bone size is limited to the bones of your hands, feet and face, and is called acromegaly.  Because acromegaly is uncommon and the physical changes occur slowly over many years, the condition sometimes takes a long time to recognize. Untreated, high levels of growth hormone can affect other parts of the body, in addition to your bones. This can lead to serious — sometimes even life-threatening — health problems. But treatment can reduce your risk of complications and significantly improve your symptoms, including the enlargement of your features.  Products & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Family Health Book, 5th Edition Show more products from Mayo Clinic Symptoms A common sign of acromegaly is enlarged hands and feet. For example, you may notice that you aren't able to put on rings that used to fit, and that your shoe size has progressively increased.  Acromegaly may also cause gradual changes in your face's shape, such as a protruding lower jaw and brow bone, an enlarged nose, thickened lips, and wider spacing between your teeth.  Because acromegaly tends to progress slowly, early signs may not be obvious for years. Sometimes, people notice the physical changes only by comparing old photos with newer ones.  Overall, acromegaly signs and symptoms tend to vary from one person to another, and may include any of the following:  Enlarged hands and feet. Enlarged facial features, including the facial bones, lips, nose and tongue. Coarse, oily, thickened skin. Excessive sweating and body odor. Small outgrowths of skin tissue (skin tags). Fatigue and joint or muscle weakness. Pain and limited joint mobility. A deepened, husky voice due to enlarged vocal cords and sinuses. Severe snoring due to obstruction of the upper airway. Vision problems. Headaches, which may be persistent or severe. Menstrual cycle irregularities in women. Erectile dysfunction in men. Loss of interest in sex. When to see a doctor If you have signs and symptoms associated with acromegaly, contact your doctor for an exam.  Acromegaly usually develops slowly. Even your family members may not notice the gradual physical changes that occur with this disorder at first. But early diagnosis is important so that you can start getting proper care. Acromegaly can lead to serious health problems if it's not treated.  Request an appointment Causes Pituitary gland and hypothalamus Pituitary gland and hypothalamus Enlarge image Acromegaly occurs when the pituitary gland produces too much growth hormone (GH) over a long period of time.  The pituitary gland is a small gland at the base of your brain, behind the bridge of your nose. It produces GH and a number of other hormones. GH plays an important role in managing your physical growth.  When the pituitary gland releases GH into your bloodstream, it triggers your liver to produce a hormone called insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) — sometimes also called insulin-like growth factor-I, or IGF-I. IGF-1 is what causes your bones and other tissues to grow. Too much GH leads to too much IGF-1, which can cause acromegaly signs, symptoms and complications.  In adults, a tumor is the most common cause of too much GH production:  Pituitary tumors. Most acromegaly cases are caused by a noncancerous (benign) tumor (adenoma) of the pituitary gland. The tumor produces excessive amounts of growth hormone, causing many of the signs and symptoms of acromegaly. Some of the symptoms of acromegaly, such as headaches and impaired vision, are due to the tumor pressing on nearby brain tissues. Nonpituitary tumors. In a few people with acromegaly, tumors in other parts of the body, such as the lungs or pancreas, cause the disorder. Sometimes, these tumors secrete GH. In other cases, the tumors produce a hormone called growth hormone-releasing hormone (GH-RH), which signals the pituitary gland to make more GH. Risk factors People who have a rare genetic condition called multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1), have a higher risk of developing acromegaly. In MEN 1, the endocrine glands — usually the parathyroid glands, pancreas and pituitary gland — grow tumors and release extra hormones. Those hormones may trigger acromegaly.  Complications If left untreated, acromegaly can lead to major health problems. Complications may include:  High blood pressure (hypertension). High cholesterol. Heart problems, particularly enlargement of the heart (cardiomyopathy). Osteoarthritis. Type 2 diabetes. Enlargement of the thyroid gland (goiter). Precancerous growths (polyps) on the lining of your colon. Sleep apnea, a condition in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep. Carpal tunnel syndrome. Increased risk of cancerous tumors. Spinal cord compression or fractures. Vision changes or vision loss. Early treatment of acromegaly can prevent these complications from developing or becoming worse. Untreated, acromegaly and its complications can lead to premature death."

It affects white blood cells, which your body needs to fight infection. It’s the most common type of cancer in children, but can also affect adults. Children have a much better chance of recovering from ALL than adults.  Contents Overview Symptoms and Causes Diagnosis and Tests Management and Treatment Prevention Outlook / Prognosis Living With Contents Overview Symptoms and Causes Diagnosis and Tests Management and Treatment Prevention Outlook / Prognosis Living With Overview What is acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)? Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (acute lymphocytic leukemia, ALL) is a rare blood cancer that affects a type of white blood cell called lymphocytes. ALL may affect anyone at any age, but children younger than 15 and adults older than 50 are more likely to develop the condition.  While ALL is a serious condition, thanks to newer treatments, including long-term chemotherapy, children with the condition can be cured, and other people are living longer with ALL.  Is ALL a common condition? No, it’s not. Acute lymphocytic leukemia accounts for less than half of 1% of all cancers in the U.S. However, ALL is the most common cancer that affects children, teenagers and young adults. Most ALL cases affect children ages 2 to 5.  Where does ALL start? It starts in your bone marrow, the spongy center of most bones that produces blood cells and platelets. Your bone marrow usually makes a carefully calibrated number of red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets that remain in your bone marrow until they mature and move into your bloodstream.  ALL affects your lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell that helps your body fight viruses and bacteria. Normally, your bone marrow produces immature white blood cells (lymphoblasts) that mature into healthy lymphocytes.  In ALL, leukemic lymphoblasts never mature. Instead, they multiply, crowding out other blood cells and platelets before moving from your bone marrow to your bloodstream and then to other areas of your body. As a result, your platelet levels are low and you’re likely to bruise more easily, bleed more than usual or develop anemia.  What are the types of acute lymphoblastic leukemia? The two main types are B-cell ALL and T-cell ALL, named for the blood cells affected by ALL:  B-cell ALL affects your B-cells, which make antibodies and help fight infection. B-cell ALL accounts for 75% to 80% of ALL cases. T-cell ALL affects your T-cells, which destroy germs and support other immune system cells. A third type, natural killer ALL, is very rare.  Symptoms and Causes What are symptoms of ALL? Most ALL symptoms come on suddenly and affect children and adults similarly. Common initial symptoms include:  Anemia. Bleeding, such as frequent nosebleeds or heavy menstrual periods. Bruising. Cough. Dizziness. Fatigue. Fever. Frequent viral infections or bacterial infections. Joint pain. Loss of appetite. Night sweats. Red, pinhead-sized spots on your skin (petechiae). Shortness of breath. Skin color that’s paler or lighter than usual. Swollen lymph nodes. Unexplained weight loss. Weakness. Many acute lymphoblastic leukemia symptoms mimic other less serious conditions. Having one or more of the symptoms listed above isn’t a sign that you have ALL. In general, you should talk to a healthcare provider about changes in your body that last more than two weeks.  What causes acute lymphoblastic leukemia? Researchers continue to find genetic mutations (changes) that cause ALL. Young children with ALL may have had genetic changes that happened before they were born. Some people have ALL because they inherited conditions that increase their chance of developing the disease. ALL in adults is linked to some carcinogens, including tobacco.  What are ALL risk factors? Risk factors include:  Sex. Girls and people assigned female at birth (AFAB) age 1 and younger have a higher risk than boys and people assigned male at birth (AMAB). After age 1, the risk is higher for people AMAB. Race. People who are white are somewhat more likely to develop ALL than people who are Black. Exposure to radiation. Children exposed to radiation in utero have an increased risk of ALL. Likewise, children and adults who had radiation therapy for other cancers have increased ALL risk. Viruses. Some viral infections, including Epstein-Barr virus or human T-cell leukemia virus, increase your risk of developing ALL. What inherited genetic conditions increase the risk of ALL? People with the following inherited conditions have a higher risk of ALL than people who don’t have the conditions:  Ataxia telangiectasia. Bloom syndrome. Down syndrome. Fanconi anemia. Klinefelter syndrome. Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Neurofibromatosis type-1 (NF1). Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. What are the complications of acute lymphoblastic leukemia? ALL that spreads to your brain and spine may cause the following complications:  Balance problems. Blurred vision. Facial muscle weakness or numbness. Headaches. Nausea and vomiting. Seizures. Enlarged liver (hepatomegaly). Enlarged spleen (splenomegaly). Superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome. Diagnosis and Tests How is acute lymphoblastic leukemia diagnosed? Your healthcare provider evaluates your symptoms, reviews your medical history and does a physical exam. If they suspect ALL, they may do the following tests, including tests to look for genetic changes:  Complete blood count (CBC). Bone marrow biopsy. Lymph node biopsy. Lumbar puncture (spinal tap). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Computed tomography (CT) scan. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan. Flow cytometry to determine ALL sub-type. Cytogenetic tests to examine cells’ chromosomes. Molecular assays to check for certain genes, proteins or other molecules that may be signs of ALL. Management and Treatment How is ALL treated? Healthcare providers may treat ALL with long-term chemotherapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy or stem cells (bone marrow) transplantation. Adults and children with ALL may receive different types of cancer drugs and treatments.  Chemotherapy Providers use chemotherapy as initial or front-line treatment for ALL. People with ALL receive chemotherapy in four phases. The treatment goal is to put ALL into complete remission. (Complete remission means treatment eliminates your symptoms, and tests show no sign of cancer.)  Chemotherapy for ALL takes place over several months and sometimes years, and typically involves high doses of cancer-killing drugs. People receiving chemotherapy for ALL should consider palliative care to help manage treatment side effects. ALL chemotherapy includes:  Remission induction therapy, which destroys as many leukemia cells as possible, so ALL goes into complete remission. Typically, people remain in the hospital during remission induction therapy. This treatment takes place over four to six weeks. Studies show more than 95% of children and 75% to 80% of adults with ALL will have complete remission after remission induction therapy. Central nervous system-directed therapy to kill any leukemia cells in your central nervous system and keep ALL from spreading to your spinal fluid. (System-directed means you have chemotherapy that affects your entire body or system.) Consolidation therapy begins once ALL is in remission. This treatment works to destroy as many remaining cancerous cells as possible. Consolidation therapy involves being in the hospital for several months while you receive high-dose chemotherapy administered weekly. Continuation or maintenance therapy is a long-term treatment that may last two to three years. You don’t have to be in the hospital to receive maintenance therapy. Targeted therapy Targeted therapy focuses on specific genetic changes. About 25% of adults and some children with ALL have chromosomal mutations. Healthcare providers currently use tyrosine kinase (TKI) therapy to treat ALL in children and adults with a specific mutation called Philadelphia chromosome or t(9;22). TKI therapy blocks an enzyme zyme essential for ALL growth. TKI therapy kills ALL cells so your body gets back to normal blood cell production.  Immunotherapy Immunotherapy helps your body’s own immune system attack cancer cells. Immunotherapy for ALL may include CAR-T cell therapy or monoclonal antibody therapy.  Radiation therapy Healthcare providers may recommend radiation therapy to treat recurrent ALL or ALL that doesn’t respond to chemotherapy. Recently, providers have used radiation therapy to treat ALL that’s spread (metastasized) to people’s brains or spinal fluid.  Allogeneic stem cell (bone marrow) transplantation When other treatments haven’t eliminated ALL, a healthcare provider may recommend allogeneic stem cell (bone marrow) transplantation to treat adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  Prevention Can ALL be prevented? No, it can’t. Children with ALL develop the condition because of genetic changes that happened before they were born. But adults with ALL may be able to lower their risk by avoiding carcinogens, including tobacco and toxic chemicals.  Outlook / Prognosis What is the prognosis for ALL? Your prognosis is the outcome you may expect after treatment. ALL often goes into complete remission after chemotherapy that kills cancerous cells. In general, children and young adults have a better prognosis than do people age 20 and older.  What is the survival rate? Acute lymphoblastic leukemia survival rates vary based on people’s ages. For example, studies show:  More than 90% of children between birth and age 14 were alive five years after diagnosis. More than 70% of children age 15 to 19 were alive five years after diagnosis. More than 30% of people age 20 and older were alive five years after diagnosis. When you think about survival rates, it’s important to remember that they’re estimates based on the experiences of people who have the same condition. Survival rates use data from the recent past, not the present. More than that, a survival rate estimate may not reflect your situation or your child’s situation. If you have questions about ALL survival rates, your healthcare provider is your best resource for information.  Is ALL curable? In some cases, yes, ALL can be cured. Children with ALL who remain in complete remission after five years are considered cured. That’s because ALL rarely recurs (comes back) after five years. Older children and adults with ALL are less likely to be cured because treatment doesn’t always put ALL into long-term remission.  Living With What’s it like to live with acute lymphoblastic leukemia? Depending on your situation, living with lymphoblastic leukemia may be like living with a chronic disease:  ALL is a rare condition. Not many people have it or know what it means to live with ALL. If you or your child have ALL, participating in support groups may help. (Along those lines, childhood cancer is rare. If your child has ALL, you and your child may benefit by working with child life specialists.) Many people with ALL need long-term chemotherapy to keep the condition in remission. Consider participating in cancer survivorship programs. (Anyone with cancer is a cancer survivor.) Survivorship programs have resources that help with issues like fear of cancer recurrence and living in remission from cancer. Children and adolescents treated for ALL will need follow-up care for the rest of their lives so providers can monitor for complications or late effects of cancer treatment. Late effects are medical issues that may develop years after people finish treatment. Smoking tobacco is a known ALL risk factor. If you’re an adult with ALL and you smoke tobacco, try to quit. If your adolescent child has ALL, consider explaining the risks of using tobacco. Cancer is stressful. Gentle exercise may help ease stress. Even young children may benefit from regular exercise to help them manage their feelings about having cancer. What questions should I ask my healthcare provider? If you or your child have acute lymphocytic leukemia, you may want to ask your healthcare provider the following questions:  What type of ALL do I have? What are possible treatments? What are the chances initial treatment will put ALL into remission? What are treatment options if ALL comes back after treatment? Are there clinical trials I should consider? A note from Cleveland Clinic  Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a rare blood cancer. Anyone can develop ALL, but it’s more common in young children than in teenagers and adults. Thanks to newer treatments, people are living longer with ALL. More than that, more children are considered cured of ALL after completing treatment.  But there are ongoing challenges in living with ALL, even ALL that’s cured. For example, most people need several years of chemotherapy before they’re considered cured. People with ALL in remission may worry the condition will come back. Children with ALL often encounter late effects. (Late effects are medical issues that develop years after people complete treatment.) If you or your child have ALL, ask your healthcare providers what you may expect to happen during treatment and beyond. They understand what it’s like to live with ALL."

The word "acute" in acute lymphocytic leukemia comes from the fact that the disease progresses rapidly and creates immature blood cells, rather than mature ones. The word "lymphocytic" in acute lymphocytic leukemia refers to the white blood cells called lymphocytes, which ALL affects. Acute lymphocytic leukemia is also known as acute lymphoblastic leukemia.  Acute lymphocytic leukemia is the most common type of cancer in children, and treatments result in a good chance for a cure. Acute lymphocytic leukemia can also occur in adults, though the chance of a cure is greatly reduced.

Many signs and symptoms of acute lymphocytic leukemia mimic those of the flu. However, flu signs and symptoms eventually improve. If signs and symptoms don't improve as expected, make an appointment with your doctor.  Request an appointment Causes Acute lymphocytic leukemia occurs when a bone marrow cell develops changes (mutations) in its genetic material or DNA. A cell's DNA contains the instructions that tell a cell what to do. Normally, the DNA tells the cell to grow at a set rate and to die at a set time. In acute lymphocytic leukemia, the mutations tell the bone marrow cell to continue growing and dividing.  When this happens, blood cell production becomes out of control. The bone marrow produces immature cells that develop into leukemic white blood cells called lymphoblasts. These abnormal cells are unable to function properly, and they can build up and crowd out healthy cells.  It's not clear what causes the DNA mutations that can lead to acute lymphocytic leukemia.  Risk factors Factors that may increase the risk of acute lymphocytic leukemia include:  Previous cancer treatment. Children and adults who've had certain types of chemotherapy and radiation therapy for other kinds of cancer may have an increased risk of developing acute lymphocytic leukemia. Exposure to radiation. People exposed to very high levels of radiation, such as survivors of a nuclear reactor accident, have an increased risk of developing acute lymphocytic leukemia. Genetic disorders. Certain genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome, are associated with an increased risk of acute lymphocytic leukemia." 
python3 medical_database/SpacyParse.py -s "https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/3929-anemia  ADVERTISEMENT Anemia Anemia occurs when there aren’t enough healthy red blood cells to carry oxygen to your body’s organs. As a result, it’s common to feel cold and symptoms of tiredness or weakness. There are many different types of anemia, but the most common type is iron-deficiency anemia. You can begin to ease symptoms of this type of anemia by adding iron to your diet.  Contents Overview Symptoms and Causes Diagnosis and Tests Management and Treatment Prevention Outlook / Prognosis Living With Contents Overview Symptoms and Causes Diagnosis and Tests Management and Treatment Prevention Outlook / Prognosis Living With Overview What is anemia? Anemia happens when you don’t have enough red blood cells or your red blood cells don’t work as they should. Your red blood cells carry oxygen throughout your body. Oxygen powers your cells and gives you energy. Without healthy red blood cells that do their job, your body doesn’t get the energy it needs to function. While some types of anemia are short-term and mild, others can last for a lifetime. Left untreated, anemia may be life-threatening.  How does anemia affect my body? When someone develops anemia, they’re said to be anemic, meaning they have symptoms of anemia, like being very tired or feeling cold all of the time. Anemia affects different people in different ways:  Newborns: Some infants are born with low red blood cell counts. Most newborns don’t need medical treatment for anemia, but some with severe anemia may need blood transfusions. Infants: Infants may get less iron than they need when they start eating solid food. That’s because the iron in solid food isn’t absorbed as easily as iron in breast milk or formula. Infants with anemia may appear lethargic. Children: Children do a lot of growing between birth and age 2. Children going through growth spurts need more iron. Children with anemia may develop related problems such as delayed development of motor skills and issues with learning. Women who are pregnant: Women who are pregnant may develop iron-deficiency anemia, which may increase the chance of complications such as premature birth or giving birth to babies with low birth weight. Women and people designated female at birth (DFAB): Women and people DFAB who have heavy periods (menstrual bleeding) or conditions like uterine fibroids may lose blood and develop anemia. People age 65 and older: People over 65 are more likely to have iron-poor diets and certain chronic diseases that increase their risk of developing anemia. If they develop anemia, they may have heart conditions or weakness that makes it hard for them to get around. They may have confusion or depression. People with chronic conditions: Some chronic conditions like autoimmune diseases or cancer may increase the risk of anemia. This is anemia of chronic disease. How common is this condition? Anemia is very common, affecting an estimated one-third of the global population and an estimated 3 million people in the United States.  What are the types of anemia? There are many anemia types, each causing red blood cell levels to drop.  Nutritional anemias Pernicious anemia: Pernicious anemia, one of the causes of vitamin B12 deficiency, is an autoimmune condition that prevents your body from absorbing vitamin B12. Iron-deficiency anemia: As its name implies, iron-deficiency anemia happens when your body doesn’t have enough iron to make hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the substance in your red blood cells that enables them to carry oxygen throughout your body. Megaloblastic anemia: Megaloblastic anemia is a type of vitamin deficiency anemia that happens when you don’t get enough vitamin B12 and/or vitamin B9 (folate). Inherited anemias Sickle cell anemia: Sickle cell anemia changes your red blood cells’ shape, turning round flexible discs into stiff and sticky sickle cells that block blood flow. Fanconi anemia: Fanconi anemia is a rare blood disorder. Anemia is one sign of Fanconi anemia. Diamond-Blackfan anemia: This inherited disorder keeps your bone marrow from making enough red blood cells. Anemias caused by abnormal red blood cells Hemolytic anemia: In this anemia, your red blood cells break down or die faster than usual. Aplastic anemia: This anemia happens when stem cells in your bone marrow don’t make enough red blood cells. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia: In autoimmune hemolytic anemia, your immune system attacks your red blood cells. Sideroblastic anemia: In sideroblastic anemia, you don’t have enough red blood cells and you have too much iron in your system. Macrocytic anemia: This anemia happens when your bone marrow makes unusually large red blood cells. Microcytic anemia: This anemia happens when your red blood cells don’t have enough hemoglobin so they’re smaller than usual. Normocytic anemia: In this type of anemia, you have fewer red blood cells than usual, and those red blood cells don’t have the normal amount of hemoglobin. Symptoms and Causes What are the symptoms of anemia? Fatigue — feeling too tired to manage your activities — is the most noticeable anemia symptom. Other symptoms may include:  Shortness of breath (dyspnea): This is the feeling you can’t catch your breath or take a deep breath. Dizziness: This is feeling lightheaded or unsteady on your feet. Fast or irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia): This is when your heart feels like it's racing or skipping beats. Pounding or “whooshing” sound in your ear (pulsatile tinnitus): This is a swooshing sound in one of your ears that may come and go. Headache: Iron-deficiency anemia and anemias caused by low hemoglobin may cause headaches. Pale or yellow skin: Your skin color may be paler than usual. Chest pain: This may feel like something is pressing on or squeezing your chest. What is the main cause of anemia? People may be born with certain types of anemia or develop anemia because they have certain chronic diseases. But poor diet causes iron-deficiency anemia, which is the most common form of anemia.  Diagnosis and Tests How do healthcare providers diagnose anemia? Your healthcare provider will ask questions about your symptoms. As anemia happens when you don’t have enough healthy red blood cells, they’ll do blood tests to check on your red blood cells:  Complete blood count (CBC): Healthcare providers use this test to check on all of your blood cells, with a focus on your red blood cells. They count your red blood cells and evaluate your red blood cells’ size and shape. Healthcare providers may use this test to check on your vitamin B12 or B9 levels. Peripheral blood smear: Healthcare providers examine your red blood cells under a microscope. Management and Treatment How do healthcare providers treat anemia? First, your healthcare provider will determine if you have anemia caused by a poor diet or a more serious health problem. They may refer you to a hematologist, a healthcare provider who specializes in blood disorders. Here are some examples of common anemia treatments:  Healthcare providers may recommend changing your diet or taking supplements if you have iron-deficiency anemia or pernicious anemia. If you have anemia because you have a chronic disease, your provider will treat the underlying condition. They may prescribe medication to boost red blood cell production. Providers may use medications like immunosuppressants or treatments like blood transfusions to treat anemias that happen when you have abnormal red blood cells, like aplastic anemia or hemolytic anemia.  Prevention Can I prevent developing anemia? You can’t prevent some kinds of anemia, such as sickle cell anemia, hemolytic anemia or aplastic anemia. People with chronic diseases who may develop anemia should watch for anemia symptoms. And you can prevent nutritional anemias by eating a healthy diet.  Outlook / Prognosis What can I expect if I have this condition? Your prognosis or expected outcome depends on why you have anemia, the type of anemia you have and whether you have a severe form of it. Most of the time, healthcare providers can treat anemia by helping you manage your diet or with medications. But there are times when you may be living with anemia for the rest of your life.  What happens if anemia isn’t treated? People who have undiagnosed or untreated anemia may have life-threatening organ failure. Children who have severe anemia may have developmental delays. People in their 80s may develop heart conditions, including angina, arrhythmias and myocardial infarction.  Living With How do I take care of myself? While some types of anemia are short-term and mild, others can last for a lifetime. There are several ways to help manage anemia, including:  Following a healthy diet: Poor diet is the primary reason why people develop anemia. Ask your healthcare provider about iron-rich foods and other foods you should eat. Drinking enough water to stay hydrated. Getting regular exercise: Check with your healthcare provider about ways to exercise safely. Avoiding exposure to certain chemicals: Exposure to certain metals may cause hemolytic anemia. Washing your hands often to avoid infection: You may also want to ask your healthcare provider about vaccines that defend against common infections. Taking good care of your teeth and going to the dentist regularly: Iron-deficiency anemia may cause dental problems. Tracking your symptoms and letting your healthcare provider know about any changes. When should I see my healthcare provider? If you have anemia, you should check with your provider if your symptoms get worse despite treatment or if you notice changes in your body that may be new symptoms of anemia.  When should I go to the emergency room? Anemia may increase your risk of a heart attack. Call 911 if you have the following symptoms:  Trouble breathing. Nausea. Sweating. Chest pain What questions should I ask my healthcare provider? Anemia may affect your body in many ways. It may happen for many different reasons. If you’re concerned about developing anemia or you have anemia, here are some questions you may want to ask your healthcare provider:  What kind of anemia do I have? What caused it? What treatments do you recommend? When will I start to feel better? How long will I need treatment? Can you cure my anemia? A note from Cleveland Clinic  Anemia happens when you don’t have enough red blood cells or your red blood cells aren’t working as well as they could. Some people are born with forms of anemia, but most people who have anemia develop the condition over time. That’s why it’s important to keep track of changes in your body. For example, we all have days when we feel worn out. But if you’re feeling very tired for several days despite getting rest, consider talking to your healthcare provider. Most of the time, anemia is a short-term issue easily treated by changing your diet or taking supplements. Untreated, anemia may cause serious medical issues."

Hemoglobin is a protein found in red cells that carries oxygen from the lungs to all other organs in the body. Having anemia can cause tiredness, weakness and shortness of breath.  There are many forms of anemia. Each has its own cause. Anemia can be short term or long term. It can range from mild to severe. Anemia can be a warning sign of serious illness.

Anemia can be so mild that it causes no symptoms at first. But symptoms usually then occur and get worse as the anemia gets worse.  If another disease causes the anemia, the disease can mask the anemia symptoms. Then a test for another condition might find the anemia. Certain types of anemia have symptoms that point to the cause.  Possible symptoms of anemia include:  Tiredness. Weakness. Shortness of breath.

This can happen if:  The body doesn't make enough hemoglobin or red blood cells. Bleeding causes loss of red blood cells and hemoglobin faster than they can be replaced. The body destroys red blood cells and the hemoglobin that's in them. What red blood cells do The body makes three types of blood cells. White blood cells fight infection, platelets help blood clot and red blood cells carry oxygen throughout the body.  Red blood cells have an iron-rich protein that gives blood its red color, called hemoglobin. Hemoglobin lets red blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to all parts of the body. And it lets red blood cells carry carbon dioxide from other parts of the body to the lungs to be breathed out.  Spongy matter inside many of the large bones, called bone marrow, makes red blood cells and hemoglobin. To make them, the body needs iron, vitamin B-12, folate and other nutrients from foods.  Causes of anemia Different types of anemia have different causes. They include:  Iron deficiency anemia. Too little iron in the body causes this most common type of anemia. Bone marrow needs iron to make hemoglobin. Without enough iron, the body can't make enough hemoglobin for red blood cells.  Pregnant people can get this type of anemia if they don't take iron supplements. Blood loss also can cause it. Blood loss might be from heavy menstrual bleeding, an ulcer, cancer or regular use of some pain relievers, especially aspirin.  Vitamin deficiency anemia. Besides iron, the body needs folate and vitamin B-12 to make enough healthy red blood cells. A diet that doesn't have enough of these and other key nutrients can result in the body not making enough red blood cells.  Also, some people can't absorb vitamin B-12. This can lead to vitamin deficiency anemia, also called pernicious anemia.  Anemia of inflammation. Diseases that cause ongoing inflammation can keep the body from making enough red blood cells. Examples are cancer, HIV/AIDS, rheumatoid arthritis, kidney disease and Crohn's disease. Aplastic anemia. This rare, life-threatening anemia occurs when the body doesn't make enough new blood cells. Causes of aplastic anemia include infections, certain medicines, autoimmune diseases and being in contact with toxic chemicals. Anemias linked to bone marrow disease. Diseases such as leukemia and myelofibrosis can affect how the bone marrow makes blood. The effects of these types of diseases range from mild to life-threatening. Hemolytic anemias. This group of anemias is from red blood cells being destroyed faster than bone marrow can replace them. Certain blood diseases increase how fast red blood cells are destroyed. Some types of hemolytic anemia can be passed through families, which is called inherited. Sickle cell anemia. This inherited and sometimes serious condition is a type of hemolytic anemia. An unusual hemoglobin forces red blood cells into an unusual crescent shape, called a sickle. These irregular blood cells die too soon. That causes an ongoing shortage of red blood cells. Risk factors These factors can increase risk of anemia:  A diet that doesn't have enough of certain vitamins and minerals. Not getting enough iron, vitamin B-12 and folate increases the risk of anemia. Problems with the small intestine. Having a condition that affects how the small intestine takes in nutrients increases the risk of anemia. Examples are Crohn's disease and celiac disease. Menstrual periods. In general, having heavy periods can create a risk of anemia. Having periods causes the loss of red blood cells. Pregnancy. Pregnant people who don't take a multivitamin with folic acid and iron are at an increased risk of anemia. Ongoing, called chronic, conditions. Having cancer, kidney failure, diabetes or another chronic condition increases the risk of anemia of chronic disease. These conditions can lead to having too few red blood cells.  Slow, chronic blood loss from an ulcer or other source within the body can use up the body's store of iron, leading to iron deficiency anemia.  Family history. Having a family member with a type of anemia passed through families, called inherited, can increase the risk of inherited anemias, such as sickle cell anemia. Other factors. A history of certain infections, blood diseases and autoimmune conditions increases the risk of anemia. Drinking too much alcohol, being around toxic chemicals, and taking some medicines can affect the making of red blood cells and lead to anemia. Age. People over age 65 are at increased risk of anemia. Complications If not treated, anemia can cause many health problems, such as:  Severe tiredness. Severe anemia can make it impossible to do everyday tasks. Pregnancy complications. Pregnant people with folate deficiency anemia may be more likely to have complications, such as premature birth. Heart problems. Anemia can lead to a rapid or irregular heartbeat, called arrhythmia. With anemia, the heart must pump more blood to make up for too little oxygen in the blood. This can lead to an enlarged heart or heart failure. Death. Some inherited anemias, such as sickle cell anemia, can lead to life-threatening complications. Losing a lot of blood quickly causes severe anemia and can be fatal. Prevention Many types of anemia can't be prevented. But eating a healthy diet might prevent iron deficiency anemia and vitamin deficiency anemias. A healthy diet includes:  Iron. Iron-rich foods include beef and other meats, beans, lentils, iron-fortified cereals, dark green leafy vegetables, and dried fruit. Folate. This nutrient, and its human-made form folic acid, can be found in fruits and fruit juices, dark green leafy vegetables, green peas, kidney beans, peanuts, and enriched grain products, such as bread, cereal, pasta and rice. Vitamin B-12. Foods rich in vitamin B-12 include meat, dairy products, and fortified cereals and soy products. Vitamin C. Foods rich in vitamin C include citrus fruits and juices, peppers, broccoli, tomatoes, melons, and strawberries. These also help the body take in iron. If you're concerned about getting enough vitamins and minerals from food, ask your health care provider about taking a multivitamin."

Stable angina (angina pectoris) is the most common type, and it’s caused by coronary artery disease. Rest and medication can ease your angina and improve your quality of life. Severe or unexpected angina signals a heart attack and needs immediate medical care.  Contents Overview Symptoms and Causes Management and Treatment Living With Contents Overview Symptoms and Causes Management and Treatment Living With Overview What is angina? Angina is chest pain or discomfort that happens when your heart isn’t receiving enough oxygen-rich blood. As a result, your heart may beat faster and harder to gain more blood, causing you noticeable pain. Angina isn’t a disease. It’s a symptom and a warning sign of heart disease.  About 10 million people in the U.S. experience angina. So, if you have this symptom, you’re certainly not alone. It’s important to learn more about angina, what causes it and how to manage it in your daily life.  Important: Angina can be a warning sign of a heart attack. If you have unexpected or severe chest pain, call 911 right away.  What does angina feel like? Most people with angina describe having chest pain or pressure. Or they describe a squeezing sensation or a tightness in their chest. Some people say it feels like indigestion. Others say it’s hard to describe angina with words.  The discomfort usually begins behind your breastbone. Sometimes, you may not be able to locate exactly where the pain is coming from.  Pain/discomfort you feel in your chest may spread to other parts of your upper body. These include your neck, jaw, shoulders, arms, back or belly.  Lack of oxygen to your heart can cause other symptoms, known as “angina equivalents.” These are symptoms that you don’t feel in your chest, including:  Fatigue. Nausea or vomiting. Shortness of breath. Sweating a lot. Infographic showing what angina may feel like in your chest and upper body. Angina feels like pain, pressure or squeezing in your chest. The discomfort may spread to other parts of your upper body like your arms or jaw.  What are the different types of angina? There are four main types of angina:  Stable angina. Unstable angina. Microvascular angina. Prinzmetal (variant) angina. What is angina pectoris? Angina pectoris is another name for stable angina. It refers to brief chest pain or discomfort that comes and goes in predictable patterns.  How is angina different from a heart attack? Both angina and a heart attack are consequences of coronary artery disease. But angina doesn’t cause permanent damage to your heart. A heart attack does. That’s because angina signals a temporary reduction in blood flow to your heart. A heart attack causes a longer reduction in blood flow. During that time, part of your heart muscle begins to die.  Another key difference is what makes the pain go away. Rest or medication (nitroglycerin) causes stable angina to go away within a few minutes. However, if you’re having a heart attack, rest or medication won’t ease your symptoms.  Stable angina doesn’t require emergency care unless your pain suddenly gets worse or doesn’t go away with rest or medication. A heart attack is a life-threatening emergency that needs immediate medical attention. There’s nothing you can do on your own to make it better.  That’s why it’s important to talk with a healthcare provider about your angina and learn what’s “normal” for you. Ask your provider what’s out of the ordinary for you and when you should call 911.  Symptoms and Causes What causes angina? Reduced blood flow to your heart (myocardial ischemia) causes angina. Several problems with your coronary arteries can prevent your heart from receiving enough blood. These include:  Coronary artery disease (CAD): This is the most common cause of angina. It happens when plaque (a fatty, waxy substance) builds up in your coronary arteries, which supply blood to your heart. These arteries narrow or harden (atherosclerosis), reducing blood flow to your heart. Coronary microvascular disease: This condition is more common among women and people assigned female at birth (AFAB) compared with men and people assigned male at birth (AMAB). It damages the walls of tiny blood vessels that branch from your coronary arteries. These blood vessels aren’t seen on typical testing for CAD and require special testing that’s not available at all medical centers. Coronary artery spasm: Your coronary arteries repeatedly constrict (tighten) then open up. These spams temporarily restrict blood flow to your heart. You can have coronary spasms without having coronary artery disease. This may not be diagnosed with routine testing for CAD and may require special testing that’s not available at all medical centers. Risk factors for angina There are many risk factors for angina. Some factors raise your risk of heart problems that directly cause angina, like coronary artery disease. Other factors limit how much oxygen-rich blood can reach your heart.  Some risk factors (like aging) can’t be changed. You may be able to manage others through lifestyle changes and medications. Talk with your provider about how to lower your risk.  Anemia (low red blood cells). Chronic stress. Diabetes. Diet high in saturated fat, trans fat, sugar, sodium or refined carbohydrates. Drinking too much alcohol. Exposure to “particle” air pollution (like dust from roads, farms or construction sites). Family history of early heart disease. Heart failure. Heart valve disease. High blood pressure. High cholesterol. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (enlarged heart). Inflammation. Long-term exposure to secondhand smoke. Metabolic syndrome. Not moving around enough (physical inactivity). Obesity. Older age (over 45 for men and people AMAB, over 55 for women and people AFAB). Smoking, vaping or using other tobacco products. Use of street drugs. Management and Treatment How is angina treated? Your healthcare provider will treat the underlying heart problem that’s causing your angina. The goals of treatment are to improve blood flow to your heart and lower your risk of complications. Your provider will give you a physical exam and perform testing to learn more about your condition and determine the best treatments.  Common treatment options include:  Anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs to lower your risk of blood clots. Blood pressure medications. Cholesterol medications. Medications used specifically to treat angina. Lifestyle changes. Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), also called coronary angioplasty and stenting. Even with treatment, some people still experience angina. Your provider may prescribe a medication to quickly open your blood vessels when you have pain. Nitroglycerin is a common angina medication.  Enhanced external counterpulsation (EECP) is another option for people with continued pain. This therapy applies pressure to your lower legs to help improve blood flow to your heart. It may help ease your angina.  What can I do at home to manage angina? Talk with your healthcare provider about how to manage angina in your daily life. They’ll offer advice based on the type of angina you have and what’s causing it. Some general tips include:  Keep a log of your angina episodes. Include the date and time, what it felt like and possible triggers (activities, emotions, weather, etc.). Also include the pain level on a scale of 1 to 10. Share the log with your provider. Know when to call for emergency help. Take medication as prescribed to treat your angina. Try to avoid the triggers that lead to an angina attack. If you have angina, you may worry about what’ll trigger an angina attack. You may wonder if it’s safe for you to do the following activities:  Drive. Exercise or play a competitive sport. Have sex. Work a job that involves manual labor. Talk with your provider about which activities are safe for you. Many people can continue their normal routine, but should keep medicine with them in case of an angina attack. You may need to reduce heavy lifting or other strenuous tasks that could trigger an angina attack. But your provider will offer guidance based on your individual situation.  How can I prevent angina? You can help prevent angina by living a heart-healthy lifestyle. Take these steps for better heart health:  Avoid smoking and all tobacco products. Also, avoid exposure to secondhand smoke. Eat a heart-healthy diet. The DASH Diet and the Mediterranean Diet are good options. Lower your intake of saturated fat, trans fat, sugar and sodium. Find new ways to manage stress. Try meditation, yoga or talking with a counselor or friend. Journal writing is another way to process emotions and concerns. Keep a weight that’s healthy for you. Ask your provider what you should aim for, and ask for advice on how to reach that goal. Manage risk factors for coronary artery disease. These include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, high triglycerides and diabetes. Move around more. Try to exercise for at least 150 minutes (2.5 hours) every week. Go for walks or find other activities you enjoy. Find a friend to join you. Take medications prescribed by your cardiologist. Many of these medications have been shown to reduce or eliminate the anginal symptoms you have. Living With When should I call my healthcare provider? Call your healthcare provider if you have:  Questions or concerns about your treatment plan. Side effects from your medications. Symptoms that are new or getting worse. When should I go to the ER? Call 911 or your local emergency number if you have symptoms of a heart attack or stroke. These are life-threatening emergencies that require immediate care. Consider printing out the symptoms so you can keep them visible at all times. Plus, share this information with your loved ones.  You should also call 911 if your stable angina suddenly becomes worse or doesn’t go away with rest or treatment.  A note from Cleveland Clinic  Angina is a common symptom of heart disease. Many people can manage their angina by learning their triggers and knowing when to rest or take medication. But sometimes, angina can be a sign of a heart attack. Knowing when to call for emergency help can save your life.  Talk with your provider about your angina. Make sure you know the difference between your “normal” angina and a more severe symptom that needs emergency care.     " 
python3 medical_database/SpacyParse.py -s "https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/angina/symptoms-causes/syc-20369373  Overview Angina (an-JIE-nuh or AN-juh-nuh) is a type of chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. Angina is a symptom of coronary artery disease.  Angina is also called angina pectoris.  Angina pain is often described as squeezing, pressure, heaviness, tightness or pain in the chest. It may feel like a heavy weight lying on the chest. Angina may be a new pain that needs to be checked by a health care provider, or recurring pain that goes away with treatment.  Although angina is relatively common, it can still be hard to distinguish from other types of chest pain, such as the discomfort of indigestion. If you have unexplained chest pain, seek medical help right away.  Types There are different types of angina. The type depends on the cause and whether rest or medication relieve symptoms.  Stable angina. Stable angina is the most common form of angina. It usually happens during activity (exertion) and goes away with rest or angina medication. For example, pain that comes on when you're walking uphill or in the cold weather may be angina.  Stable angina pain is predictable and usually similar to previous episodes of chest pain. The chest pain typically lasts a short time, perhaps five minutes or less.  Unstable angina (a medical emergency). Unstable angina is unpredictable and occurs at rest. Or the angina pain is worsening and occurs with less physical effort. It's typically severe and lasts longer than stable angina, maybe 20 minutes or longer. The pain doesn't go away with rest or the usual angina medications. If the blood flow doesn't improve, the heart is starved of oxygen and a heart attack occurs. Unstable angina is dangerous and requires emergency treatment. Variant angina (Prinzmetal angina). Variant angina, also called Prinzmetal angina, isn't due to coronary artery disease. It's caused by a spasm in the heart's arteries that temporarily reduces blood flow. Severe chest pain is the main symptom of variant angina. It most often occurs in cycles, typically at rest and overnight. The pain may be relieved by angina medication. Refractory angina. Angina episodes are frequent despite a combination of medications and lifestyle changes. Symptoms  Blocked artery and injured tissue in a heart attack  Heart attack Enlarge image Angina symptoms include chest pain and discomfort. The chest pain or discomfort may feel like:  Burning Fullness Pressure Squeezing Pain may also be felt in the arms, neck, jaw, shoulder or back.  Other symptoms of angina include:  Dizziness Fatigue Nausea Shortness of breath Sweating The severity, duration and type of angina can vary. New or different symptoms may signal a more dangerous form of angina (unstable angina) or a heart attack.  Any new or worsening angina symptoms need to be evaluated immediately by a health care provider who can determine whether you have stable or unstable angina.  Angina in women Symptoms of angina in women can be different from the classic angina symptoms. These differences may lead to delays in seeking treatment. For example, chest pain is a common symptom in women with angina, but it may not be the only symptom or the most prevalent symptom for women. Women may also have symptoms such as:  Discomfort in the neck, jaw, teeth or back Nausea Shortness of breath Stabbing pain instead of chest pressure Stomach (abdominal) pain When to see a doctor If your chest pain lasts longer than a few minutes and doesn't go away when you rest or take your angina medications, it may be a sign you're having a heart attack. Call 911 or emergency medical help. Only drive yourself to the hospital if there is no other transportation option.  If chest discomfort is a new symptom for you, it's important to see your health care provider to determine the cause and to get proper treatment. If you've been diagnosed with stable angina and it gets worse or changes, seek medical help immediately.

Blood carries oxygen, which the heart muscle needs to survive. When the heart muscle isn't getting enough oxygen, it causes a condition called ischemia.  The most common cause of reduced blood flow to the heart muscle is coronary artery disease (CAD). The heart (coronary) arteries can become narrowed by fatty deposits called plaques. This is called atherosclerosis.  If plaques in a blood vessel rupture or a blood clot forms, it can quickly block or reduce flow through a narrowed artery. This can suddenly and severely decrease blood flow to the heart muscle.  During times of low oxygen demand — when resting, for example — the heart muscle may still be able to work on the reduced amount of blood flow without triggering angina symptoms. But when the demand for oxygen goes up, such as when exercising, angina can result.  More Information Coronary artery spasm: Cause for concern? Risk factors The following things may increase the risk of angina:  Increasing age. Angina is most common in adults age 60 and older. Family history of heart disease. Tell your health care provider if your mother, father or any siblings have or had heart disease or a heart attack. Tobacco use. Smoking, chewing tobacco and long-term exposure to secondhand smoke can damage the lining of the arteries, allowing deposits of cholesterol to collect and block blood flow. Diabetes. Diabetes increases the risk of coronary artery disease, which leads to angina and heart attacks by speeding up atherosclerosis and increasing cholesterol levels. High blood pressure. Over time, high blood pressure damages arteries by accelerating hardening of the arteries. High cholesterol or triglycerides. Too much bad cholesterol — low-density lipoprotein (LDL) — in the blood can cause arteries to narrow. A high LDL increases the risk of angina and heart attacks. A high level of triglycerides in the blood also is unhealthy. Other health conditions. Chronic kidney disease, peripheral artery disease, metabolic syndrome or a history of stroke increases the risk of angina. Not enough exercise. An inactive lifestyle contributes to high cholesterol, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and obesity. Talk to your health care provider about the type and amount of exercise that's best for you. Obesity. Obesity is a risk factor for heart disease, which can cause angina. Being overweight makes the heart work harder to supply blood to the body. Emotional stress. Too much stress and anger can raise blood pressure. Surges of hormones produced during stress can narrow the arteries and worsen angina. Medications. Drugs that tighten blood vessels, such as some migraine drugs, may trigger Prinzmetal's angina. Drug misuse. Cocaine and other stimulants can cause blood vessel spasms and trigger angina. Cold temperatures. Exposure to cold temperatures can trigger Prinzmetal angina. Complications The chest pain that occurs with angina can make doing some activities, such as walking, uncomfortable. However, the most dangerous complication is a heart attack.  Warning signs and symptoms of a heart attack include: Pressure, fullness or a squeezing pain in the center of the chest that lasts for more than a few minutes Pain extending beyond the chest to the shoulder, arm, back, or even to the teeth and jaw Fainting Impending sense of doom Increasing episodes of chest pain Nausea and vomiting Continued pain in the upper belly area (abdomen) Shortness of breath Sweating If you have any of these symptoms, seek emergency medical attention immediately.  Prevention You can help prevent angina by following the same lifestyle changes that are used to treat angina. These include:  Not smoking. Eating a healthy diet. Avoiding or limiting alcohol. Exercising regularly. Maintaining a healthy weight. Managing other health conditions related to heart disease. Reducing stress. Getting recommended vaccines to avoid heart complications." 
python3 medical_database/SpacyParse.py -s "https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/12061-arthritis  Arthritis Arthritis is extremely common, especially in people older than 50. It causes joint pain, stiffness and inflammation. Your provider will help you understand which type of arthritis you have, what’s causing it and which treatments you’ll need. You may need a joint replacement if you have severe arthritis that you can’t manage with other treatments.  Contents Overview Symptoms and Causes Diagnosis and Tests Management and Treatment Prevention Outlook / Prognosis Living With Additional Common Questions Contents Overview Symptoms and Causes Diagnosis and Tests Management and Treatment Prevention Outlook / Prognosis Living With Additional Common Questions Overview  Learn about the differences between osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis. What is arthritis? Arthritis is a disease that causes damage in your joints. Joints are places in your body where two bones meet.  Some joints naturally wear down as you age. Lots of people develop arthritis after that normal, lifelong wear and tear. Some types of arthritis happen after injuries that damage a joint. Certain health conditions also cause arthritis.  Arthritis can affect any joint, but is most common in people’s:  Hands and wrists. Knees. Hips. Feet and ankles. Shoulders. Lower back (lumbar spine). A healthcare provider will help you find ways to manage symptoms like pain and stiffness. Some people with severe arthritis eventually need surgery to replace their affected joints.  Visit a healthcare provider if you’re experiencing joint pain that’s severe enough to affect your daily routine or if it feels like you can’t move or use your joints as well as usual.  Types of arthritis There are more than 100 different types of arthritis. Some of the most common types include:  Osteoarthritis: Wear and tear arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis: Arthritis that happens when your immune system mistakenly damages your joints. Gout: Arthritis that causes sharp uric acid crystals to form in your joints. Ankylosing spondylitis: Arthritis that affects joints near your lower back. Psoriatic arthritis: Arthritis that affects people who have psoriasis. Juvenile arthritis: Arthritis in kids and teens younger than 16. Depending on which type of arthritis you have, it can break down the natural tissue in your joint (degeneration) or cause inflammation (swelling). Some types cause inflammation that leads to degeneration.  How common is arthritis? Arthritis is extremely common. Experts estimate that more than one-third of Americans have some degree of arthritis in their joints.  Osteoarthritis is the most common type. Studies have found that around half of all adults will develop osteoarthritis at some point.  Symptoms and Causes What are arthritis symptoms and signs? The most common arthritis symptoms and signs include:  Joint pain. Stiffness or reduced range of motion (how far you can move a joint). Swelling (inflammation). Skin discoloration. Tenderness or sensitivity to touch around a joint. A feeling of heat or warmth near your joints. Where you experience symptoms depends on which type of arthritis you have, and which of your joints it affects.  Some types of arthritis cause symptoms in waves that come and go called flares or flare-ups. Others make your joints feel painful or stiff all the time, or after being physically active.  What is the main cause of arthritis? What causes arthritis varies depending on which type you have:  Osteoarthritis happens naturally as you age — a lifetime of using your joints can eventually wear down their cartilage cushioning. You may develop gout if you have too much uric acid in your blood (hyperuricemia). Your immune system can cause arthritis (including rheumatoid arthritis) when it damages your joints by mistake. Certain viral infections (including COVID-19) can trigger viral arthritis. Sometimes, arthritis happens with no cause or trigger. Providers call this idiopathic arthritis. What are the risk factors? Anyone can develop arthritis, but some factors may make you more likely to, including:  Tobacco use: Smoking and using other tobacco products increases your risk. Family history: People whose biological family members have arthritis are more likely to develop it. Activity level: You might be more likely to have arthritis if you aren’t physically active regularly. Other health conditions: Having autoimmune diseases, obesity or any condition that affects your joints increases the chances you’ll develop arthritis. Some people have a higher arthritis risk, including:  People older than 50. People assigned female at birth (AFAB). Athletes, especially those who play contact sports. People who have physically demanding jobs or do work that puts a lot of stress on their joints (standing, crouching, being on your hands and knees for a long time, etc.). At what age does arthritis usually start? Arthritis can develop at any age. When it starts depends on which type you have and what’s causing it.  In general, osteoarthritis affects adults older than 50. Rheumatoid arthritis usually develops in adults age 30 to 60.  Other types that have a more direct cause usually start closer to that specific trigger. For example, people with post-traumatic arthritis don’t develop it until after their joints are injured, and gout doesn’t develop until after you’ve had high uric acid levels for at least several months.  Talk to a healthcare provider about your unique arthritis risk, and when you should start watching for signs or changes in your joints.  Diagnosis and Tests How do healthcare providers diagnose arthritis? A healthcare provider will diagnose arthritis with a physical exam. They’ll examine your affected joints and ask about your symptoms. Tell your provider when you first noticed symptoms like pain and stiffness, and if any activities or times of day make them worse.  Your provider will probably check your range of motion (how far you can move a joint). They may compare one joint’s range of motion to other, similar joints (your other knee, ankle or fingers, for example).  Arthritis tests Your provider might use imaging tests to take pictures of your joints, including:  X-ray. Ultrasound. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A computed tomography (CT) scan. These tests can help your provider see damage inside your joints. They can also help your provider rule out other injuries or issues that might cause similar symptoms, like bone fractures (broken bones).  Your provider may use blood tests to check your uric acid levels if they think you have gout. Blood tests can also show signs of infections or autoimmune diseases.  Management and Treatment What is arthritis treatment? There’s no cure for arthritis, but your healthcare provider will help you find treatments that manage your symptoms. Which treatments you’ll need depend on what’s causing the arthritis, which type you have and which joints it affects.  The most common arthritis treatments include:  Over-the-counter (OTC) anti-inflammatory medicine like NSAIDs or acetaminophen. Corticosteroids (prescription anti-inflammatory medicine, including cortisone shots). Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) if you have rheumatoid or psoriatic arthritis. Physical therapy or occupational therapy can help you improve your strength, range of motion and confidence while you’re moving. Surgery (usually only if nonsurgical treatments don’t relieve your symptoms). Arthritis surgery You may need surgery if you have severe arthritis and other treatments don’t work. The two most common types of arthritis surgery are joint fusion and joint replacement.  Joint fusion is exactly what it sounds like: surgically joining bones together. It’s most common for bones in your spine (spinal fusion) or your ankle (ankle fusion).  If your joints are damaged or you’ve experienced bone loss, you might need an arthroplasty (joint replacement). Your surgeon will remove your damaged natural joint and replace it with a prosthesis (artificial joint). You might need a partial or total joint replacement.  Your provider or surgeon will tell you which type of surgery you’ll need and what to expect.  Prevention How do I prevent arthritis? Some forms of arthritis happen naturally or because of health conditions you can’t change, so there’s not always a way to prevent it. However, you can lower your chances of developing arthritis by:  Avoiding tobacco products. Following a diet and exercise plan that’s healthy for you. Doing low-impact exercise. Always wearing proper protective equipment for any activity that could damage your joints. Outlook / Prognosis What can I expect if I have arthritis? You should expect to manage arthritis symptoms for a long time (probably the rest of your life). Your provider will help you find treatments that reduce how much (and how often) arthritis impacts your daily routine.  Some people with arthritis experience more severe symptoms as they age. Ask your provider how often you should have follow-up visits to check for changes in your joints.  Living With When should I see my healthcare provider? Visit your healthcare provider if you experience any of the following symptoms:  Severe pain (especially if it lasts for more than a week). Stiffness that’s getting worse, especially if you suddenly can’t move a joint as well as you usually can. Worsening or more frequent flare-ups of your usual symptoms. Which questions should I ask my healthcare provider? Questions you can ask your provider include:  Which type of arthritis do I have? Which treatments will I need? Will I need surgery? How often will I need follow-up exams? Additional Common Questions What is the fastest way to relieve arthritis pain? Everyone’s body responds differently to different treatments, so there’s no one answer that works for everyone. Your provider will help you find a combination of treatments that relieves your arthritis pain. You might be able to take over-the-counter or prescription medicine as soon as you feel arthritis symptoms flaring up. Some people take arthritis medicine regularly to help prevent pain before it gets bad enough to affect their day-to-day activities.  Staying active is one of the best ways to relieve arthritis symptoms. Don’t force yourself to do anything that causes severe pain, but stretching and moving your body can reduce pain and stiffness and prevent them from getting worse.  You don’t need to become an ultramarathoner or Olympic weightlifter. Walking, swimming, riding a bike and stretching or doing yoga are all great ways to support your joints and strengthen muscles throughout your body.  Talk to your provider or physical therapist about exercises that are good for you. They’ll suggest options that help you safely stay active.  Do certain types of weather make arthritis worse? Some people find that their arthritis feels worse during certain types of weather. Humidity and cold are two common joint pain triggers.  There are a variety of reasons why this might happen. People tend to be less active in rainy seasons and winter. The cold and damp can also stiffen your joints and aggravate arthritis. Other theories suggest that barometric pressure (the pressure of the air around you), may have some effect on arthritis.  Talk to your healthcare provider if you feel like certain weather conditions or seasons make arthritis worse. They’ll suggest ways to prevent pain and stiffness throughout the year, or they may modify your arthritis treatments to fit any changes in your environment.  A note from Cleveland Clinic  Arthritis is one of the most common health conditions people experience. But, just because lots of people have it, that doesn’t mean you should live in pain. Talk to a healthcare provider about ways to manage arthritis symptoms. They’ll help you find ways to spend more time doing the activities you love, and less time feeling stiff and uncomfortable.  Arthritis can be a pain in the neck (and knees, and hips, and back and any other joint in your body), but try to stay as active as possible. Ask your provider about physical or occupational therapy to help you stay strong, active and confident throughout your daily routine."

The main symptoms of arthritis are joint pain and stiffness, which typically worsen with age. The most common types of arthritis are osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.  Osteoarthritis causes cartilage — the hard, slippery tissue that covers the ends of bones where they form a joint — to break down. Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease in which the immune system attacks the joints, beginning with the lining of joints.

Causes The two main types of arthritis — osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis — damage joints in different ways.  Osteoarthritis The most common type of arthritis, osteoarthritis involves wear-and-tear damage to a joint's cartilage — the hard, slick coating on the ends of bones where they form a joint. Cartilage cushions the ends of the bones and allows nearly frictionless joint motion, but enough damage can result in bone grinding directly on bone, which causes pain and restricted movement. This wear and tear can occur over many years, or it can be hastened by a joint injury or infection.  Osteoarthritis also causes changes in the bones and deterioration of the connective tissues that attach muscle to bone and hold the joint together. If cartilage in a joint is severely damaged, the joint lining may become inflamed and swollen.  Rheumatoid arthritis In rheumatoid arthritis, the body's immune system attacks the lining of the joint capsule, a tough membrane that encloses all the joint parts. This lining (synovial membrane) becomes inflamed and swollen. The disease process can eventually destroy cartilage and bone within the joint.  Risk factors Risk factors for arthritis include:  Family history. Some types of arthritis run in families, so you may be more likely to develop arthritis if your parents or siblings have the disorder. Age. The risk of many types of arthritis — including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and gout — increases with age. Your sex. Women are more likely than men to develop rheumatoid arthritis, while most of the people who have gout, another type of arthritis, are men. Previous joint injury. People who have injured a joint, perhaps while playing a sport, are more likely to eventually develop arthritis in that joint. Obesity. Carrying excess pounds puts stress on joints, particularly your knees, hips and spine. People with obesity have a higher risk of developing arthritis. Complications Severe arthritis, particularly if it affects your hands or arms, can make it difficult for you to do daily tasks. Arthritis of weight-bearing joints can keep you from walking comfortably or sitting up straight. In some cases, joints may gradually lose their alignment and shape."

The disease causes fibrosis (scarring) of your lungs and pleura. Asbestosis can be managed, but not cured.  Contents Overview Symptoms and Causes Diagnosis and Tests Management and Treatment Prevention Outlook / Prognosis Living With Additional Common Questions Contents Overview Symptoms and Causes Diagnosis and Tests Management and Treatment Prevention Outlook / Prognosis Living With Additional Common Questions Overview What is asbestosis? Asbestosis is a lung disease that occurs in people who inhale asbestos fibers and dust over a long period of time. Asbestos is a mineral that forms tiny and long-lasting fibers.  When asbestos fibers and dust get into your lungs, they can cause fibrosis (thickening and scarring of the lungs). Asbestos can also cause the membranes surrounding your lungs (the pleura) to thicken. This scarring and thickening of lung tissue can make breathing difficult.  In some cases, asbestosis can lead to life-threatening complications, including lung cancer and heart failure. In severe cases, asbestosis can be fatal.  Who is affected by asbestosis? You’re more at risk of getting asbestosis if you have long-term exposure to asbestos. This is true if your job involves handling materials containing asbestos. These types of jobs include:  Asbestos miners, installers or removers. Auto and aircraft mechanics. Construction crews. Electrical workers. Railroad and shipyard workers. Even if you don’t work with asbestos, you could be at risk if you live with someone who comes home from one of these jobs and has dust or fibers on their clothing. You can also be at risk of breathing in particles if you’re around a demolition site or you’re near an asbestos mine.  Most people with asbestosis inhaled asbestos particles while at work before the 1970s. At that time, the U.S. government enacted regulations to limit on-the-job asbestos exposure.  Today, you’re unlikely to develop asbestosis if you follow safety regulations. However, asbestosis can take a long time to appear. Doctors sometimes diagnose asbestosis in people who acquired the disease many years ago.  Symptoms and Causes What are the signs and symptoms of asbestosis? Symptoms of asbestosis vary depending on the severity of the disease. Symptoms may not appear for 20 to 30 years or more after asbestos exposure.  The first symptom of asbestosis you might notice is having trouble breathing (being short of breath), especially when you’re working hard or exercising. Other signs and symptoms may include:  Chest pain and tightness. Clubbing of your nails (large, rounded fingernails and toenails). Cough. Crackling sound when inhaling. Fatigue (extreme tiredness) and trouble exercising. Unintended weight loss. What causes asbestosis? The main cause of asbestosis is inhaling asbestos fibers or dust over a long period of time. This leads to the thickening and scarring of your lungs and pleura (very thin tissue, or membrane, that line your lungs).  Breathing in asbestos particles in the air causes asbestosis. Undisturbed asbestos — such as in insulation or tile — doesn’t increase your risk of the disease.  Building and manufacturing industries used asbestos widely in the past. As a result, some people developed asbestosis after repeatedly inhaling asbestos particles while at work in these industries.  Materials and products that may contain asbestos include:  Car clutch pads and brake linings. Construction cement, putties and plaster. Insulation. Pipe wrapping. Siding and roof shingles. Vinyl floor tiles. Diagnosis and Tests How is asbestosis diagnosed? Your healthcare provider will examine you and ask about your medical history. Remember to tell them about your exposure to any harmful substances like asbestos.  Your healthcare provider may also order tests to complete the diagnosis. These might include:  A chest X-ray. A computed tomography (CT) scan. Lung function tests like spirometry. Management and Treatment How is asbestosis treated? Treating asbestosis aims to manage symptoms and preserve function in your lungs. Your treatment depends on the severity of the disease. Your options might include:  Oxygen therapy: Receiving extra oxygen through a mask or tube in your nostrils help you breathe more comfortably. Pulmonary rehabilitation: Exercises and behavioral changes can improve your daily functioning. Lung transplant surgery: In rare cases, a new, healthy lung from a lung transplant can relieve symptoms and prolong life. What can I do at home to manage the symptoms of asbestosis? To make things easier on you if you have asbestosis, you can follow a healthy lifestyle by:  Not smoking. If you do smoke, get help quitting. This is probably the most important thing you can do. Avoiding breathing air contaminated with allergens, pollution or secondhand smoke. Avoiding sick people and practicing good hand washing hygiene. Drinking lots of water. Eating a healthy diet. Exercising regularly after discussing an exercise plan or routine with your healthcare provider. What are the complications that may be associated with asbestosis? Many people who have asbestosis have breathing trouble and a cough that doesn’t go away. In more severe cases, complications can be life-threatening.  Complications of asbestosis may include:  Lung cancer: Cancer that develops inside your lungs. People who have asbestosis who smoke cigarettes have a higher risk of lung cancer. Malignant mesothelioma: Cancer that forms in the lining of your abdomen, chest or lungs. Respiratory failure: Your lungs can’t put enough oxygen into your blood, and carbon dioxide builds up in your tissues. Right-sided heart failure (cor pulmonale): The right side of your heart stops working correctly. Prevention How can you prevent asbestosis? You can reduce your risk of asbestosis by avoiding long-term exposure to asbestos. If your job involves exposure to the mineral, you should wear a respirator (a mask that filters particles from the air). This protective mask keeps you from inhaling asbestos fibers or dust.  If you know you’ve had asbestos exposure, you should have regular exams and chest X-rays. These tests don’t prevent asbestosis but can help catch it early.  If you’ve been exposed to asbestos and you smoke, quitting smoking is your best way to reduce your risk of getting cancer.  Outlook / Prognosis What is the prognosis (outlook) for people with asbestosis? Asbestosis can’t be cured. You can’t reverse the damage from the disease. Once you breathe in asbestos fibers, they stay in your body. Your prognosis varies depending on how long and how much exposure you had to the particles.  Many people with mild asbestosis live fulfilling lives for many years after being diagnosed, but some cases get worse over time. You may need medical management throughout your life.  Your healthcare provider is likely to order chest X-rays and lung function tests every few years to look for changes in the scarring in your lungs. The findings on your imaging tests will change as the stages of your condition progress.  You should stay current with vaccines, especially the pneumococcal vaccine and the influenza vaccine. Also, ask your healthcare provider about vaccination for COVID-19 infection.  Does asbestosis affect life expectancy? A severe case of asbestosis can cause death. However, many people continue living many years after diagnosis.  Living With When should I see a healthcare provider? Contact your healthcare provider if you’ve been exposed to asbestos and have trouble breathing, chest discomfort or a cough that doesn’t go away. Be sure to tell your doctor about your asbestos exposure, even if it’s second-hand.  What questions should I ask my healthcare provider? If you have asbestosis, you may want to ask your healthcare provider these questions:  How severe is my asbestosis? What type of treatment will help my symptoms? What can I do to avoid complications of asbestosis? What can I do to help my symptoms? Additional Common Questions What is the difference between asbestosis and mesothelioma? The main difference between asbestosis and mesothelioma is that mesothelioma is cancer and asbestosis isn’t cancer. The disease of asbestosis remains in your lungs and pleura (the covering of your lungs). Mesothelioma begins in the tissue of your lungs and abdomen. It can spread throughout your body. Having asbestosis doesn’t mean you won’t have cancer. It’s possible to develop lung cancer or mesothelioma later on.  Can you live with asbestosis? Yes, you can live with asbestosis. Many people live long and fulfilling lives after being diagnosed with asbestosis.  Can lungs heal from asbestos? Asbestosis can’t be cured. The scarring in your lungs doesn’t heal.  What are pleural plaques? Pleural plaques are thick spots in your pleura (the very thin tissues that line your lungs). You do get pleural plaques from asbestos exposure, but they don’t cause symptoms. They aren’t the same as asbestosis, mesothelioma or lung cancer. Having pleural plaques doesn’t increase your risk for those diseases.  A note from Cleveland Clinic  If you work or ever worked with asbestosis, or live with someone who is working with asbestos, help yourself by not smoking. If you feel any type of new difficulties breathing, talk with your healthcare provider about your concerns. There are ways to manage your condition if you have asbestosis." 
python3 medical_database/SpacyParse.py -s "https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/asbestosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20354637  Overview Asbestosis (as-bes-TOE-sis) is a chronic lung disease caused by inhaling asbestos fibers. Prolonged exposure to these fibers can cause lung tissue scarring and shortness of breath. Asbestosis symptoms can range from mild to severe, and usually don't appear until many years after initial exposure.  Bronchioles and alveoli in the lungs Bronchioles and alveoli in the lungs In your lungs, the main airways, called bronchi, branch off into smaller and smaller passageways. The smallest airways, called bronchioles, lead to tiny air sacs called alveoli.  Asbestos is a natural mineral product that's resistant to heat and corrosion. It was used extensively in the past in products such as insulation, cement and some floor tiles.  Most people with asbestosis acquired it on the job before the federal government began regulating the use of asbestos and asbestos products in the 1970s. Today, its handling is strictly regulated. Getting asbestosis is extremely unlikely if you follow your employer's safety procedures. Only trained and accredited asbestos professionals should manage asbestos products. Treatment focuses on relieving your symptoms.  Products & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Family Health Book, 5th Edition Newsletter: Mayo Clinic Health Letter — Digital Edition Symptoms The effects of long-term exposure to asbestos typically don't show up until 10-40 years after initial exposure. Symptoms can vary in severity.  Clubbing of fingers Clubbing of fingers Clubbing of the fingers, in which the fingertips spread out and become rounder than usual, is often linked to heart or lung conditions.  Asbestosis signs and symptoms may include:  Shortness of breath A persistent, dry cough Chest tightness or pain Dry and crackling sounds in your lungs when you inhale Fingertips and toes that appear wider and rounder than usual (clubbing) When to see a doctor If you have a history of exposure to asbestos and you're experiencing increasing shortness of breath, talk to your health care provider about the possibility of asbestosis.  Request an appointment Causes If you are exposed to high levels of asbestos dust over a long period of time, some of the airborne fibers can become lodged within your alveoli — the tiny sacs inside your lungs where oxygen is exchanged for carbon dioxide in your blood. The asbestos fibers irritate and scar lung tissue, causing the lungs to become stiff. This makes it difficult to breathe.  As asbestosis progresses, more and more lung tissue becomes scarred. Eventually, your lung tissue becomes so stiff that it can't contract and expand normally.  Smoking appears to increase the retention of asbestos fibers in the lungs, and often results in a faster progression of the disease.  Risk factors People who worked in mining, milling, manufacturing, and installation or removal of asbestos products before the late 1970s are at highest risk of asbestosis. Examples include:  Asbestos miners Aircraft and auto mechanics Boiler operators Building construction workers Electricians Railroad workers Refinery and mill workers Shipyard workers Workers removing asbestos insulation around steam pipes in older buildings Risk of asbestosis is generally related to the amount and the duration of exposure to asbestos. The greater the exposure is, the greater the risk is of lung damage.  Secondhand exposure is possible for household members of exposed workers, as asbestos fibers may be carried home on clothing. People living close to mines may also be exposed to asbestos fibers released into the air.  Complications If you have asbestosis, you're at increased risk of developing lung cancer — especially if you smoke or have a history of smoking. Rarely, malignant mesothelioma, a cancer of the tissue around the lung, can occur many years after exposure to asbestos.  Prevention Reducing exposure to asbestos is the best prevention against asbestosis. In the United States, federal law requires employers in industries that work with asbestos products — such as construction — to take special safety measures.  Many homes, schools and other buildings built before the 1970s have materials such as pipes and floor tiles that contain asbestos. Generally, there's no risk of exposure as long as the asbestos is enclosed and undisturbed. It's when materials containing asbestos are damaged that there's a danger of asbestos fibers being released into the air and inhaled. Always have asbestos products inspected and repaired or removed by trained and accredited asbestos professionals."

Some types include allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), aspergilloma, chronic pulmonary aspergillosis and invasive aspergillosis. They usually affect people with weakened immune systems or lung conditions. Treatments include surgery and antifungal medications.  Contents Overview Symptoms and Causes Diagnosis and Tests Management and Treatment Prevention Outlook / Prognosis Living With Contents Overview Symptoms and Causes Diagnosis and Tests Management and Treatment Prevention Outlook / Prognosis Living With Overview What is aspergillosis? Aspergillosis is a term for an infection caused by several types of Aspergillus fungi (plural of fungus). Aspergillus is usually found outdoors, in dead leaves, plants, soil or compost. It’s occasionally found in moist environments indoors. Most people breathe in Aspergillus spores every day without getting sick. But in certain people, Aspergillus can cause allergic reactions, chronic lung conditions and invasive disease that spreads to your brain, kidneys, lungs or other organs.  Is Aspergillus black mold? Aspergillus isn’t black mold. “Black mold” is a common term used for the fungus Stachybotrys chartarum. This isn’t the same mold that causes aspergillosis, but both are common molds that can make some people sick.  What does aspergillosis feel like? Aspergillosis can cause symptoms similar to many other illnesses, like fever, cough and shortness of breath. If you’re at risk for aspergillosis, talk to a healthcare provider if you have any of these symptoms.  Who does aspergillosis affect? Different types of aspergillosis are more likely to affect certain people: Allergic aspergillosis usually affects people with asthma, bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis. Chronic forms of aspergillosis usually affect people with chronic lung conditions, like COPD, sarcoidosis and tuberculosis. Invasive aspergillosis usually affects people with a weakened immune system. This includes people who’ve had an organ or stem cell transplant, those who use corticosteroids regularly, those who have diabetes and those with too few of certain white blood cells (neutropenia). What are the types of aspergillosis? Types of aspergillosis include:  Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (APPA). Aspergilloma (“fungus ball”). Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis. Invasive aspergillosis. Fever is a common symptom. Symptoms and Causes What are the symptoms of aspergillosis? Symptoms of aspergillosis vary depending on the type and location in your body. Symptoms of infections or allergic reactions in your lungs are the most common. They include:  Coughing (sometimes coughing up blood). Shortness of breath (dyspnea). Noisy breathing (wheezing). Chest pain. Fever. Fatigue and weight loss can be symptoms of chronic pulmonary aspergillosis.  You may have additional symptoms if the infection spreads to other parts of your body, including:  Body part	Type	Symptoms Eyes.	Fungal keratitis.	Red eyes; eye pain; blurred vision. Sinuses.	Allergic or invasive Aspergillus sinusitis.	Stuffy or runny nose; headache; reduced sense of smell. Skin.	Cutaneous aspergillosis.	Red, hardened patches; may progress to ulcers that turn black. Brain.	Cerebral aspergillosis.	Mood changes; confusion; seizures; weakness. Stomach and intestines.	Gastrointestinal aspergillosis.	Fever; abdominal pain; diarrhea; constipation. Sinuses, nasal passages, mouth and brain.	Rhinocerebral aspergillosis.	Fever; swelling on one side of your face; headaches; stuffy nose; nasal pain; bloody mucus in your nose; drooping eyelids; black pus draining from your mouth, nose or eyes. What causes aspergillosis? Many different species of the fungi Aspergillus cause aspergillosis. A. fumigatus is the most common cause.  Aspergillus lives in the environment around us, so we can easily breathe it in. Most people’s bodies eliminate Aspergillus fungus without getting sick. But certain conditions, like a weakened immune system or chronic lung disease, can make it easier to get sick from Aspergillus.  How do you get an Aspergillus infection? Inhaling Aspergillus from the air can cause an allergic reaction or an infection in your sinuses or lungs. From there, it can move to other parts of your body if your immune system can’t fight off the infection. It can also get into your body through a cut in your skin.  Is aspergillosis contagious? No, aspergillosis isn’t contagious. You can’t catch it from another person.  Diagnosis and Tests How is aspergillosis diagnosed? How a provider diagnoses aspergillosis depends on your symptoms and health history. Imaging like X-rays or CT scans, tests of fluid or tissue, and allergy tests all help to diagnose various forms of aspergillosis. Its symptoms look similar to many other illnesses, so your provider may need to do additional tests to rule out other conditions.  What tests will be done to diagnose aspergillosis? Tests a provider may order to diagnose aspergillosis include:  Allergy tests. Your provider may order blood or skin tests to diagnose allergic or chronic forms of aspergillosis. Biopsy. Your provider may take samples of tissue or fluid to test for signs of an Aspergillus infection. Blood tests. A blood test can help diagnose invasive aspergillosis early in people who have severely weakened immune systems. Culture. Your provider may take samples of your body fluids — such as blood, mucus (sputum), or fluid from around your lungs, brain or spinal cord — and try to grow Aspergillus from it. Imaging. Your provider may use X-rays or CT scans to look for signs of Aspergillus in the area of your body they think might be infected. Management and Treatment How is aspergillosis treated? How your provider treats aspergillosis depends on the type and any underlying conditions you have. Surgery, antifungal medications and corticosteroids are the most common treatment options.  Surgery for aspergillosis Surgery can often cure aspergillosis caused by a single fungus ball. Providers also use it to treat invasive and allergic aspergillosis in certain circumstances. Providers usually don’t recommend surgery to treat chronic pulmonary aspergillosis.  Antifungal treatments for aspergillosis Antifungal medications treat many kinds of aspergillosis. If one type of antifungal isn’t working, your provider may prescribe a different one. Possible antifungal treatments include:  Voriconazole, isavuconazole, posaconazole or itraconazole. Liposomal amphotericin B. Caspofungin or micafungin. Corticosteroids for aspergillosis Corticosteroids (like prednisone, prednisolone and methylprednisolone) reduce inflammation. A provider might prescribe them to treat allergic forms of aspergillosis or skin infections. Which one you’re prescribed depends on where in your body you have an infection. Different types of corticosteroids include:  Oral (pills you swallow). Inhaled (breathed in through your mouth with an inhaler). Nasal (a mist you spray into your nose). Topical (applied to your skin). Can aspergillosis be cured? Surgery or antifungals can cure some types of noninvasive aspergillosis. In some cases, it may go away and come back again (recur). Invasive aspergillosis can be very hard to cure.  Prevention How can I prevent aspergillosis? It’s hard to avoid Aspergillus molds. If you’re at high risk for infection, talk to your provider about the best ways to protect yourself. Your provider might:  Prescribe an antifungal medicine to prevent infection. Test you for signs of infection to make sure you get treated early. You might be able to reduce your exposure to fungi by:  Avoiding areas with lots of dust or mold, such as construction sites or compost piles. Avoiding activities such as gardening or lawn mowing. If you might be exposed to airborne dust or mold, wear an N95 face mask. Outlook / Prognosis What can I expect if I have aspergillosis? Everyone’s body responds to aspergillosis differently. What you can expect depends on your health, underlying conditions and what type of aspergillosis you have. Talk to your provider about what to expect in your specific situation. Most people will need follow-up screenings, even if they are successfully treated.  What’s the outlook for aspergillosis? The outlook for aspergillosis depends on the form:  Aspergillomas that haven’t invaded tissue usually aren’t dangerous and can be successfully treated with surgery. Allergic forms of aspergillosis aren’t usually life-threatening but can cause lung damage if they go untreated for a long time. Chronic pulmonary aspergillosis can complicate underlying conditions like COPD. It can be life-threatening. Treatment often helps symptoms, but the infection can come back again and again. Invasive aspergillosis can be life-threatening. Since people with invasive aspergillosis almost always have an immune system that can’t fight off the infection, it can be hard to treat. If you have invasive aspergillosis, you’ll need to be treated as soon as possible and monitored closely. Aspergillosis complications Your risk of experiencing complications depends on which type of aspergillosis you have. All types can cause lung damage, including:  Scarring (fibrosis). Widening of your airways (bronchiectasis). Collapsed areas of lung (atelectasis). Invasive and chronic aspergillosis can cause additional complications, including:  Moving to and damaging other organs. Tissue destruction. Respiratory failure. Sepsis. Living With When should I see a healthcare provider? Ask a healthcare provider how to prevent and detect fungal infections early if you:  Have had an organ or stem cell transplant. Are on chemotherapy for cancer. Have HIV or AIDS. Have diabetes. Have a chronic lung condition, such as asthma, COPD, sarcoidosis or tuberculosis. Have a condition or take medications that weaken your immune system. When should I go to the ER? If you have symptoms of any kind of infection and you have a weakened immune system, talk to your provider right away or seek emergency care. Go to the nearest emergency room if you have symptoms of serious illness, including:  High fever (over 103 degrees Fahrenheit/40 degrees Celsius). Difficulty breathing. Coughing up blood. Confusion or other mental changes. Seizures. Black skin, tissue or mucus. Blue skin, lips or nails (cyanosis, a sign of low oxygen in your blood). What questions should I ask my doctor? Which type of aspergillosis do I have? How do I take my medications? What are my treatment options? What are the risks of treatment? How can I treat my symptoms at home? What precautions should I take to avoid fungal infections? Can I detect a fungal infection early? A note from Cleveland Clinic  Aspergillosis is a broad term for many types of illnesses caused by species of Aspergillus fungi. Some forms are mild, but some cause life-threatening illness. Talk to your healthcare provider about what to expect in your specific situation. If you have a weakened immune system or a lung condition, ask your provider about prevention and early detection.

python3 medical_database/SpacyParse.py -s "https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/aspergillosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20369619  Overview Aspergillosis is an infection caused by a type of mold (fungus). The illnesses resulting from aspergillosis infection usually affect the respiratory system, but their signs and severity vary greatly.  The mold that triggers the illnesses, aspergillus, is everywhere — indoors and outdoors. Most strains of this mold are harmless, but a few can cause serious illnesses when people with weakened immune systems, underlying lung disease or asthma inhale their fungal spores.  In some people, the spores trigger an allergic reaction. Other people develop mild to serious lung infections. The most serious form of aspergillosis — invasive aspergillosis — occurs when the infection spreads to blood vessels and beyond.  Depending on the type of aspergillosis, treatment may involve observation, antifungal medications or, in rare cases, surgery.  Products & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Family Health Book, 5th Edition Newsletter: Mayo Clinic Health Letter — Digital Edition Symptoms The signs and symptoms of aspergillosis vary with the type of illness you develop:  Allergic reaction Some people with asthma or cystic fibrosis have an allergic reaction to aspergillus mold. Signs and symptoms of this condition, known as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, include:  Fever A cough that may bring up blood or plugs of mucus Worsening asthma Aspergilloma Certain chronic lung (pulmonary) conditions, such as emphysema, tuberculosis or advanced sarcoidosis, can cause air spaces (cavities) to form in the lungs. When people with lung cavities are also infected with aspergillus, fungus fibers may find their way into the cavities and grow into tangled masses (fungus balls) known as aspergillomas.  Aspergillomas may produce no symptoms or cause only a mild cough at first. Over time and without treatment, however, aspergillomas can worsen the underlying chronic lung condition and possibly cause:  A cough that often brings up blood (hemoptysis) Wheezing Shortness of breath Unintentional weight loss Fatigue Invasive aspergillosis This is the most severe form of aspergillosis. It occurs when the infection spreads rapidly from the lungs to the brain, heart, kidneys or skin. Invasive aspergillosis occurs only in people whose immune systems are weakened as a result of cancer chemotherapy, bone marrow transplantation or a disease of the immune system. Untreated, this form of aspergillosis may be fatal.  Signs and symptoms depend on which organs are affected, but in general, invasive aspergillosis can cause:  Fever and chills A cough that brings up blood (hemoptysis) Shortness of breath Chest or joint pain Headaches or eye symptoms Skin lesions Other types of aspergillosis Aspergillus can invade areas of your body other than your lungs, such as your sinuses. In your sinuses, the fungus can cause a stuffy nose sometimes accompanied by drainage that may contain blood. Fever, facial pain and headache may also occur.  When to see a doctor If you have asthma or cystic fibrosis, see your doctor whenever you notice a change in your breathing. Although aspergillosis may not be the cause, it's important to have breathing problems evaluated.  If you have a weakened immune system and develop an unexplained fever, shortness of breath or a cough that brings up blood, get immediate medical care. In the case of invasive aspergillosis, prompt treatment is crucial. In some cases, treatment with antifungal medication begins as soon as aspergillosis is suspected, even before testing has confirmed the diagnosis.  Request an appointment Causes Aspergillus mold is unavoidable. Outdoors, it's found in decaying leaves and compost and on plants, trees and grain crops.  Everyday exposure to aspergillus is rarely a problem for people with healthy immune systems. When mold spores are inhaled, immune system cells surround and destroy them. But people who have a weakened immune system from illness or immunosuppressant medications have fewer infection-fighting cells. This allows aspergillus to take hold, invading the lungs and, in the most serious cases, other parts of the body.  Aspergillosis is not contagious from person to person.  Risk factors Your risk of developing aspergillosis depends on your overall health and the extent of your exposure to mold. In general, these factors make you more vulnerable to infection:  Weakened immune system. People taking immune-suppressing drugs after undergoing transplant surgery — especially bone marrow or stem cell transplants — or people who have certain cancers of the blood are at highest risk of invasive aspergillosis. People in the later stages of AIDS also may be at increased risk. Low white blood cell level. People who have had chemotherapy, an organ transplant or leukemia have lower white cell levels, making them more susceptible to invasive aspergillosis. So does having chronic granulomatous disease — an inherited disorder that affects immune system cells. Lung cavities. People who have air spaces (cavities) in their lungs are at higher risk of developing aspergillomas. Asthma or cystic fibrosis. People with asthma and cystic fibrosis, especially those whose lung problems are long-standing or hard to control, are more likely to have an allergic response to aspergillus mold. Long-term corticosteroid therapy. Long-term use of corticosteroids may increase the risk of opportunistic infections, depending on the underlying disease being treated and what other drugs are being used. Complications Depending on the type of infection, aspergillosis can cause a variety of serious complications:  Bleeding. Both aspergillomas and invasive aspergillosis can cause severe, and sometimes fatal, bleeding in your lungs. Systemic infection. The most serious complication of invasive aspergillosis is the spread of the infection to other parts of your body, especially your brain, heart and kidneys. Invasive aspergillosis spreads rapidly and may be fatal. Prevention It's nearly impossible to avoid exposure to aspergillus, but if you have had a transplant or are undergoing chemotherapy, try to stay away from places where you're likely to encounter mold, such as construction sites, compost piles and buildings that store grain. If you have a weakened immune system, your doctor may advise you to wear a face mask to avoid being exposed to aspergillus and other airborne infectious agents."

Your airways get narrow and swollen and are blocked by excess mucus. Medications can treat these symptoms.  Contents Overview Symptoms and Causes Diagnosis and Tests Management and Treatment Prevention Outlook / Prognosis Living With Additional Common Questions Contents Overview Symptoms and Causes Diagnosis and Tests Management and Treatment Prevention Outlook / Prognosis Living With Additional Common Questions Overview The normal airways of a woman having an asthma attack become constricted, inflamed and full of mucus. Asthma causes bronchospasms, inflammation, thick mucus and constriction in the airways. What is asthma? Asthma, also called bronchial asthma, is a disease that affects your lungs. It’s a chronic (ongoing) condition, meaning it doesn’t go away and needs ongoing medical management.  Asthma affects more than 25 million people in the U.S. currently. This total includes more than 5 million children. Asthma can be life-threatening if you don’t get treatment.  What is an asthma attack? When you breathe normally, muscles around your airways are relaxed, letting air move easily and quietly. During an asthma attack, three things can happen:  Bronchospasm: The muscles around the airways constrict (tighten). When they tighten, it makes your airways narrow. Air cannot flow freely through constricted airways. Inflammation: The lining of your airways becomes swollen. Swollen airways don’t let as much air in or out of your lungs. Mucus production: During the attack, your body creates more mucus. This thick mucus clogs airways. When your airways get tighter, you make a sound called wheezing when you breathe, a noise your airways make when you breathe out. You might also hear an asthma attack called an exacerbation or a flare-up. It’s the term for when your asthma isn’t controlled.  What types of asthma are there? Asthma is broken down into types based on the cause and the severity of symptoms. Healthcare providers identify asthma as:  Intermittent: This type of asthma comes and goes so you can feel normal in between asthma flares. Persistent: Persistent asthma means you have symptoms much of the time. Symptoms can be mild, moderate or severe. Healthcare providers base asthma severity on how often you have symptoms. They also consider how well you can do things during an attack. Asthma has multiple causes:  Allergic: Some people’s allergies can cause an asthma attack. Allergens include things like molds, pollens and pet dander. Non-allergic: Outside factors can cause asthma to flare up. Exercise, stress, illness and weather may cause a flare. Asthma can also be:  Adult-onset: This type of asthma starts after the age of 18. Pediatric: Also called childhood asthma, this type of asthma often begins before the age of 5, and can occur in infants and toddlers. Children may outgrow asthma. You should make sure that you discuss it with your provider before you decide whether your child needs to have an inhaler available in case they have an asthma attack. Your child’s healthcare provider can help you understand the risks. In addition, there are these types of asthma:  Exercise-induced asthma: This type is triggered by exercise and is also called exercise-induced bronchospasm. Occupational asthma: This type of asthma happens primarily to people who work around irritating substances. Asthma-COPD overlap syndrome (ACOS): This type happens when you have both asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Both diseases make it difficult to breathe. Who can get asthma? Anyone can develop asthma at any age. People with allergies or people exposed to tobacco smoke are more likely to develop asthma. This includes secondhand smoke (exposure to someone else who is smoking) and thirdhand smoke (exposure to clothing or surfaces in places where some has smoked).  Statistics show that people assigned female at birth tend to have asthma more than people assigned male at birth. Asthma affects Black people more frequently than other races.  Symptoms and Causes What causes asthma? Researchers don’t know why some people have asthma while others don’t. But certain factors present a higher risk:  Allergies: Having allergies can raise your risk of developing asthma. Environmental factors: People can develop asthma after exposure to things that irritate the airways. These substances include allergens, toxins, fumes and second- or third-hand smoke. These can be especially harmful to infants and young children whose immune systems haven’t finished developing. Genetics: If your family has a history of asthma or allergic diseases, you have a higher risk of developing the disease. Respiratory infections: Certain respiratory infections, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), can damage young children’s developing lungs. What are common asthma attack triggers? You can have an asthma attack if you come in contact with substances that irritate you. Healthcare providers call these substances “triggers.” Knowing what triggers your asthma makes it easier to avoid asthma attacks.  For some people, a trigger can bring on an attack right away. For other people, or at other times, an attack may start hours or days later.  Triggers can be different for each person. But some common triggers include:  Air pollution: Many things outside can cause an asthma attack. Air pollution includes factory emissions, car exhaust, wildfire smoke and more. Dust mites: You can’t see these bugs, but they are in our homes. If you have a dust mite allergy, this can cause an asthma attack. Exercise: For some people, exercising can cause an attack. Mold: Damp places can spawn mold, which can cause problems if you have asthma. You don’t even have to be allergic to mold to have an attack. Pests: Cockroaches, mice and other household pests can cause asthma attacks. Pets: Your pets can cause asthma attacks. If you’re allergic to pet dander (dried skin flakes), breathing in the dander can irritate your airways. Tobacco smoke: If you or someone in your home smokes, you have a higher risk of developing asthma. You should never smoke in enclosed places like the car or home, and the best solution is to quit smoking. Your provider can help. Strong chemicals or smells. These things can trigger attacks in some people. Certain occupational exposures. You can be exposed to many things at your job, including cleaning products, dust from flour or wood, or other chemicals. These can all be triggers if you have asthma. What are the signs and symptoms of asthma? People with asthma usually have obvious symptoms. These signs and symptoms resemble many respiratory infections:  Chest tightness, pain or pressure. Coughing (especially at night). Shortness of breath. Wheezing. With asthma, you may not have all of these symptoms with every flare. You can have different symptoms and signs at different times with chronic asthma. Also, symptoms can change between asthma attacks.  Diagnosis and Tests How do healthcare providers diagnose asthma? Your healthcare provider will review your medical history, including information about your parents and siblings. Your provider will also ask you about your symptoms. Your provider will need to know any history of allergies, eczema (a bumpy rash caused by allergies) and other lung diseases.  Your provider may order spirometry. This test measures airflow through your lungs and is used to diagnose and monitor your progress with treatment. Your healthcare provider may order a chest X-ray, blood test or skin test.  Management and Treatment What asthma treatment options are there? You have options to help manage your asthma. Your healthcare provider may prescribe medications to control symptoms. These include:  Bronchodilators: These medicines relax the muscles around your airways. The relaxed muscles let the airways move air. They also let mucus move more easily through the airways. These medicines relieve your symptoms when they happen and are used for intermittent and chronic asthma. Anti-inflammatory medicines: These medicines reduce swelling and mucus production in your airways. They make it easier for air to enter and exit your lungs. Your healthcare provider may prescribe them to take every day to control or prevent your symptoms of chronic asthma. Biologic therapies for asthma: These are used for severe asthma when symptoms persist despite proper inhaler therapy. You can take asthma medicines in several different ways. You may breathe in the medicines using a metered-dose inhaler, nebulizer or another type of asthma inhaler. Your healthcare provider may prescribe oral medications that you swallow.  What is asthma control? The goal of asthma treatment is to control symptoms. Asthma control means you:  Can do the things you want to do at work and home. Have no (or minimal) asthma symptoms. Rarely need to use your reliever medicine (rescue inhaler). Sleep without asthma interrupting your rest. How do you monitor asthma symptoms? You should keep track of your asthma symptom. It’s an important piece of managing the disease. Your healthcare provider may ask to use a peak flow (PF) meter. This device measures how fast you can blow air out of your lungs. It can help your provider make adjustments to your medication. It also tells you if your symptoms are getting worse.  Prevention How can I prevent an asthma attack? If your healthcare provider says you have asthma, you’ll need to figure out what triggers an attack. Avoiding the triggers can help you avoid an attack. You can’t prevent yourself from getting asthma, though.  Outlook / Prognosis What’s the outlook for someone with asthma? If you have asthma, you can still live a very productive life and participate in sports and other activities. Your healthcare provider can help you manage symptoms, learn your triggers and prevent or manage attacks.  Living With What is an asthma action plan? Your healthcare provider will work with you to develop an asthma action plan. This plan tells you how and when to use your medicines. It also tells you what to do based on your asthma symptoms and when to seek emergency care. Ask your healthcare provider about anything you don’t understand.  What should I do if I have a severe asthma attack? If you have a severe asthma attack, you need to get immediate medical care.  The first thing you should do is use your rescue inhaler. A rescue inhaler uses fast-acting medicines to open up your airways. It’s different than a maintenance inhaler, which you use every day. You should use the rescue inhaler when symptoms are bothering you and you can use it more frequently if your flare is severe.  If your rescue inhaler doesn’t help or you don’t have it with you, go to the emergency department if you have:  Anxiety or panic. Bluish fingernails, bluish lips (in light-skinned people) or gray or whitish lips or gums (in dark-skinned people). Chest pain or pressure. Coughing that won’t stop or severe wheezing when you breathe. Difficulty talking. Pale, sweaty face. Very quick or rapid breathing. Additional Common Questions How do you know if do or don’t have asthma? You’ll need to see a healthcare provider to find out if you have asthma or some other condition. There are other respiratory diseases that make it hard to breathe or cause coughing and wheezing.  Can asthma be cured? No. Asthma can’t be cured, but it can be managed. Children may outgrow asthma as they get older.  Why is my asthma worse at night? Asthma that gets worse at night is sometimes called nighttime asthma or nocturnal asthma. There are no definite reasons that this happens, but there are some educated guesses. These include:  The way you sleep: Sleeping on your back can result in mucus dripping into your throat or acid reflux coming back up from your stomach. Also, sleeping on your back puts pressure on your chest and lungs, which makes breathing more difficult. However, lying face down or on your side can put pressure on your lungs. Triggers in your bedroom and triggers that happen in the evening: You may find your blankets, sheets and pillows have dust mites, mold or pet hair on them. If you’ve been outside in the early evening, you may have brought pollen in with you. Medication side effects: Some drugs that treat asthma, such as steroids and montelukast, can affect your sleep. Air that’s too hot or too cold: Hot air can cause airways to narrow when you breathe in. Cold air is an asthma trigger for some people. Lung function changes: Lung function lessens at night as a natural process. Asthma is poorly controlled during the day: Symptoms that aren’t controlled during the day won’t be better at night. It’s important to work with your provider to make sure your asthma symptoms are controlled both day and night. Treating nighttime symptoms is very important. Serious asthma attacks, and sometimes deaths, can happen at night. What should I know about COVID-19 and asthma? If you have asthma that is moderate-to-severe, or if your asthma symptoms aren’t well controlled, you’re at greater risk of having to be hospitalized if you get COVID-19. Therefore, you should wear a mask if you go to indoor spaces with other people, get vaccinated and avoid exposure to people who have the virus.  A note from Cleveland Clinic  Many people live fulfilling lives with asthma. Some professional athletes with asthma have set records in their sports. Your healthcare provider can help you find the best way to manage your asthma. Talk to your healthcare provider about how to control your symptoms."

This can make breathing difficult and trigger coughing, a whistling sound (wheezing) when you breathe out and shortness of breath.  For some people, asthma is a minor nuisance. For others, it can be a major problem that interferes with daily activities and may lead to a life-threatening asthma attack.  Asthma can't be cured, but its symptoms can be controlled. Because asthma often changes over time, it's important that you work with your doctor to track your signs and symptoms and adjust your treatment as needed.  Products & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Book of Home Remedies Symptoms Asthma symptoms vary from person to person. You may have infrequent asthma attacks, have symptoms only at certain times — such as when exercising — or have symptoms all the time.  Asthma signs and symptoms include:  Shortness of breath Chest tightness or pain Wheezing when exhaling, which is a common sign of asthma in children Trouble sleeping caused by shortness of breath, coughing or wheezing Coughing or wheezing attacks that are worsened by a respiratory virus, such as a cold or the flu Signs that your asthma is probably worsening include:  Asthma signs and symptoms that are more frequent and bothersome Increasing difficulty breathing, as measured with a device used to check how well your lungs are working (peak flow meter) The need to use a quick-relief inhaler more often For some people, asthma signs and symptoms flare up in certain situations:  Exercise-induced asthma, which may be worse when the air is cold and dry Occupational asthma, triggered by workplace irritants such as chemical fumes, gases or dust Allergy-induced asthma, triggered by airborne substances, such as pollen, mold spores, cockroach waste, or particles of skin and dried saliva shed by pets (pet dander) When to see a doctor Seek emergency treatment Severe asthma attacks can be life-threatening. Work with your doctor to determine what to do when your signs and symptoms worsen — and when you need emergency treatment. Signs of an asthma emergency include:  Rapid worsening of shortness of breath or wheezing No improvement even after using a quick-relief inhaler Shortness of breath when you are doing minimal physical activity Contact your doctor See your doctor:  If you think you have asthma. If you have frequent coughing or wheezing that lasts more than a few days or any other signs or symptoms of asthma, see your doctor. Treating asthma early may prevent long-term lung damage and help keep the condition from getting worse over time. To monitor your asthma after diagnosis. If you know you have asthma, work with your doctor to keep it under control. Good long-term control helps you feel better from day to day and can prevent a life-threatening asthma attack. If your asthma symptoms get worse. Contact your doctor right away if your medication doesn't seem to ease your symptoms or if you need to use your quick-relief inhaler more often.  Don't take more medication than prescribed without consulting your doctor first. Overusing asthma medication can cause side effects and may make your asthma worse.  To review your treatment. Asthma often changes over time. Meet with your doctor regularly to discuss your symptoms and make any needed treatment adjustments.

Causes It isn't clear why some people get asthma and others don't, but it's probably due to a combination of environmental and inherited (genetic) factors.  Asthma triggers Exposure to various irritants and substances that trigger allergies (allergens) can trigger signs and symptoms of asthma. Asthma triggers are different from person to person and can include:  Airborne allergens, such as pollen, dust mites, mold spores, pet dander or particles of cockroach waste Respiratory infections, such as the common cold Physical activity Cold air Air pollutants and irritants, such as smoke Certain medications, including beta blockers, aspirin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve) Strong emotions and stress Sulfites and preservatives added to some types of foods and beverages, including shrimp, dried fruit, processed potatoes, beer and wine Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a condition in which stomach acids back up into your throat More Information Asthma care at Mayo Clinic Asthma and acid reflux Risk factors A number of factors are thought to increase your chances of developing asthma. They include:  Having a blood relative with asthma, such as a parent or sibling Having another allergic condition, such as atopic dermatitis — which causes red, itchy skin — or hay fever — which causes a runny nose, congestion and itchy eyes Being overweight Being a smoker Exposure to secondhand smoke Exposure to exhaust fumes or other types of pollution Exposure to occupational triggers, such as chemicals used in farming, hairdressing and manufacturing Complications Asthma complications include:  Signs and symptoms that interfere with sleep, work and other activities Sick days from work or school during asthma flare-ups A permanent narrowing of the tubes that carry air to and from your lungs (bronchial tubes), which affects how well you can breathe Emergency room visits and hospitalizations for severe asthma attacks Side effects from long-term use of some medications used to stabilize severe asthma Proper treatment makes a big difference in preventing both short-term and long-term complications caused by asthma.  Prevention While there's no way to prevent asthma, you and your doctor can design a step-by-step plan for living with your condition and preventing asthma attacks.  Follow your asthma action plan. With your doctor and health care team, write a detailed plan for taking medications and managing an asthma attack. Then be sure to follow your plan.  Asthma is an ongoing condition that needs regular monitoring and treatment. Taking control of your treatment can make you feel more in control of your life.  Get vaccinated for influenza and pneumonia. Staying current with vaccinations can prevent flu and pneumonia from triggering asthma flare-ups. Identify and avoid asthma triggers. A number of outdoor allergens and irritants — ranging from pollen and mold to cold air and air pollution — can trigger asthma attacks. Find out what causes or worsens your asthma, and take steps to avoid those triggers. Monitor your breathing. You may learn to recognize warning signs of an impending attack, such as slight coughing, wheezing or shortness of breath.  But because your lung function may decrease before you notice any signs or symptoms, regularly measure and record your peak airflow with a home peak flow meter. A peak flow meter measures how hard you can breathe out. Your doctor can show you how to monitor your peak flow at home.  Identify and treat attacks early. If you act quickly, you're less likely to have a severe attack. You also won't need as much medication to control your symptoms.  When your peak flow measurements decrease and alert you to an oncoming attack, take your medication as instructed. Also, immediately stop any activity that may have triggered the attack. If your symptoms don't improve, get medical help as directed in your action plan.  Take your medication as prescribed. Don't change your medications without first talking to your doctor, even if your asthma seems to be improving. It's a good idea to bring your medications with you to each doctor visit. Your doctor can make sure you're using your medications correctly and taking the right dose. Pay attention to increasing quick-relief inhaler use. If you find yourself relying on your quick-relief inhaler, such as albuterol, your asthma isn't under control. See your doctor about adjusting your treatment." 
python3 medical_database/SpacyParse.py -s "https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/8576-astigmatism  ADVERTISEMENT Astigmatism Astigmatism is a common type of refractive error. It means that some part of your eye (either the cornea or lens) is more curved than it should be. This altered eye shape makes your vision blurry. Most cases of astigmatism can be treated with corrective lenses like eyeglasses or contact lenses.  Contents Overview Symptoms and Causes Diagnosis and Tests Management and Treatment Prevention Outlook / Prognosis Living With Contents Overview Symptoms and Causes Diagnosis and Tests Management and Treatment Prevention Outlook / Prognosis Living With Overview An illustration showing how astigmatism causes blurry vision If you have astigmatism, light that enters your eye bends unevenly. This makes your vision blurry. What is astigmatism? Astigmatism is the medical term that means the shape of your eye is more curved than it should be. It’s a type of refractive error — an extremely common eye condition that causes blurred vision.  Usually, eyes are round, like a baseball. If you have astigmatism, your eye is shaped like a football or the back of a spoon. This makes light that enters your eyes bend unevenly and affects your vision at all distances.  Visit an eye care specialist as soon as you notice any changes in your eyes or feel like your vision isn’t as clear as it used to be.  What does astigmatism do to your vision? The parts of your eyes work together like a relay team to pass light that enters your eye along a pathway to your brain. Light passes through your cornea — the clear part at the front of your eye. Your cornea focuses that light through your lens into a signal that hits your retina — the layer at the very back of your eyeball. Your retina converts that light into electrical signals that your optic nerve sends to your brain. Your brain then uses those signals to create the images you see.  If you have astigmatism, light that enters your eye is bent more than it should be. The light can’t properly focus on your retina. This means only parts of an object you’re looking at are in focus. That uneven focus makes objects look blurry or wavy. Astigmatism can affect your vision at any distance — both up close and farther away.  You might experience eye strain — like your eyes are constantly working too hard to see.  What are the types of astigmatism? Astigmatism is usually caused by your cornea having an irregular shape. Eye care specialists call this corneal astigmatism.  You can also have lenticular astigmatism, where the lens in your eye has an irregular shape. Lenticular astigmatism is often caused by cataracts.  Some people have both corneal and lenticular astigmatism.  Who is affected by astigmatism? Anyone can experience astigmatism. You can develop it at any point in your life. Some people are born with astigmatism. Others don’t develop it until they’re adults. It can get better or worse over time.  Astigmatism is very common. 1 in 3 people has astigmatism.  Symptoms and Causes What are astigmatism symptoms? Blurred vision is the most common astigmatism symptom. It also makes it hard to see details on objects, like the words printed on a menu in front of you, or letters on a road sign in the distance.  Other astigmatism symptoms include:  Seeing a glare or halos around lights. Squinting to see clearly. Headaches. Fatigue. Eye strain. Some young children don’t know there’s anything wrong with their vision, even if they’re experiencing symptoms. Visit an eye care specialist if you notice your child squinting, rubbing their eyes or having frequent headaches.  What causes astigmatism? Astigmatism is usually hereditary, which means it’s a condition biological parents pass down to their children. It can also be caused by your eyelids putting too much pressure on your cornea.  Astigmatism usually isn’t caused by health conditions. Some conditions and issues that can cause astigmatism include:  Eye injuries. Keratoconus. Complications after eye surgery. Diagnosis and Tests How is astigmatism diagnosed? An eye care specialist will diagnose astigmatism with an eye exam. They’ll look at your eyes (including inside them).  Your eye care specialist might use a few tests to diagnose astigmatism, including:  Visual acuity test: A visual acuity test is a test that checks your vision. You’ve had a visual acuity test if you’ve ever looked at a wall chart of letters or symbols during an eye exam. Refraction test: Your eye care specialist will measure how much light focuses and is bent as it enters your eye. Keratometry: Keratometry measures your cornea’s curve. Slit lamp exam: A slit lamp is a special microscope with a bright light that your eye care specialist shines into your eye. They’ll adjust the brightness and thickness of the light’s beam to see the different layers and parts of your eye. Management and Treatment How is astigmatism treated? Most people with astigmatism need corrective lenses. Your eye care specialist will recommend eyeglasses or contact lenses to help you see clearly.  If the astigmatism is very mild (and doesn’t affect your vision), you might not need glasses or contacts. Your eye care specialist will measure any changes in your eye during future eye exams. Astigmatism can change over time and get worse, so you might need glasses or contacts eventually, even if you don’t at first.  Can astigmatism be corrected? Wearing glasses or contacts will correct your vision, but they won’t change the shape of your eye. Vision correction surgery (including LASIK eye surgery and photorefractive keratectomy or PRK eye surgery) uses lasers to fix vision problems. A specially trained ophthalmologist will perform these procedures to change the shape of your cornea so light hits your retina correctly.  People who have cataracts and astigmatism can have both treated at the same time during cataract surgery.  These surgeries will reduce astigmatism and improve your vision. Talk to your eye care specialist if you’re interested in vision correction surgery.  Prevention How can I prevent astigmatism? You can’t prevent astigmatism. Most people who have astigmatism are born with it. Others develop it as their eyes grow and change throughout their lives.  If you have astigmatism or another type of refractive error, there’s a chance your children might as well.  When should I have my eyes examined? Having your eyes and vision checked regularly can help an eye care specialist identify problems right away. How often you should get your eyes checked usually depends on your age.  Kids: A pediatrician should check your child’s eyes at every well-child visit until they’re old enough to start school, and then every one to two years. Adults younger than 40: Every five to 10 years. Adults between 40 and 54: Every two to four years. Adults older than 55: Every one to three years. You might need your eyes checked more often than this if you wear glasses, contacts or need another type of visual aid. People with diabetes also need their eyes checked more often than what’s listed here.  Ask an eye care specialist how often you need an eye exam.  Outlook / Prognosis What can I expect if I have astigmatism? If you have a small degree of astigmatism that doesn’t affect your vision, you might not need any treatment. If you have a significant astigmatism that makes it hard to see clearly, there are lots of ways your eye care specialist can treat it. Many people with astigmatism only need glasses or contact lenses.  Most people who have vision correction surgery have permanently improved vision. Some people need an enhancement procedure as they get older. This follow-up procedure will correct any changes in the astigmatism that happen after your eyes naturally change shape as you age.  Living With When should I see an eye care specialist? Visit an eye care specialist as soon as you notice any changes in your eyes — especially if your vision is getting noticeably worse or blurry. Astigmatism symptoms are usually very noticeable at night, when it’s raining or when you look at lights.  What questions should I ask my eye care specialist? Which type of astigmatism do I have? Will I need corrective lenses? Are glasses or contacts better for my eyes? Am I a good candidate for vision correction surgery? How often should I have my eyes examined? A note from Cleveland Clinic  Astigmatism is a common condition that makes the shape of your eye more curved than it should be. The blurry vision astigmatism causes can be annoying and make it hard to participate in your daily routine. Fortunately, most people with astigmatism only need glasses or contacts to see clearly. Talk to your eye care specialist if you’re interested in vision correction surgery.  Young children probably won’t be able to understand or tell you that their vision is worse. Visit an eye care specialist if you notice your child squinting a lot or having frequent headaches.     " 
python3 medical_database/SpacyParse.py -s "https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/astigmatism/symptoms-causes/syc-20353835  Overview Astigmatism (uh-STIG-muh-tiz-um) is a common and generally treatable imperfection in the curvature of the eye that causes blurred distance and near vision.  Astigmatism occurs when either the front surface of the eye (cornea) or the lens inside the eye has mismatched curves. Instead of having one curve like a round ball, the surface is egg-shaped. This causes blurred vision at all distances.  Astigmatism is often present at birth and may occur in combination with nearsightedness or farsightedness. Often it's not pronounced enough to require corrective action. When it is, treatment options are corrective lenses or surgery.  Products & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Guide to Better Vision Symptoms Signs and symptoms of astigmatism may include:  Blurred or distorted vision Eyestrain or discomfort Headaches Difficulty with night vision Squinting When to see a doctor See an eye doctor if your eye symptoms detract from your enjoyment of activities or interfere with your ability to perform everyday tasks. An eye doctor can determine whether you have astigmatism and, if so, to what degree. He or she can then advise you of your options to correct your vision.  Children and adolescents Children may not realize their vision is blurry, so they need to be screened for eye disease and have their vision tested by a pediatrician, an ophthalmologist, an optometrist or another trained screener at the following ages and intervals.  During the newborn period At well-child visits until they reach school age During school years, every 1 to 2 years at well-child visits, at the eye doctor, or through school or public screenings Request an appointment Causes The eye has two structures with curved surfaces that bend (refract) light onto the retina, which makes the images:  The cornea, the clear front surface of the eye along with the tear film The lens, a clear structure inside the eye that changes shape to help the eye focus on near objects In a perfectly shaped eye, each of these elements has a round curvature, like the surface of a smooth ball. A cornea or lens with such curvature bends (refracts) all incoming light equally to make a sharply focused image directly on the retina at the back of the eye.  Simplified anatomy of the eye Simplified anatomy of the eye This simplified illustration of the eye shows the elements most involved in astigmatism: the cornea and the lens.  A refractive error If either the cornea or the lens is egg-shaped with two mismatched curves, light rays aren't bent the same, which means that two different images form. These two images overlap or combine and result in blurred vision. Astigmatism is a type of refractive error.  Astigmatism occurs when the cornea or lens is curved more steeply in one direction than in another. You have corneal astigmatism if your cornea has mismatched curves. You have lenticular astigmatism if your lens has mismatched curves.  Either type of astigmatism can cause blurred vision. Blurred vision may occur more in one direction: horizontally, vertically or diagonally.  Astigmatism may be present from birth, or it may develop after an eye injury, disease or surgery. Astigmatism isn't caused or made worse by reading in poor light, sitting too close to the television or squinting.  Astigmatism Astigmatism Astigmatism is a type of refractive error caused when either the cornea or the lens has mismatched curves. This makes vision blurry because there are two image points.  Other refractive errors Astigmatism may occur in combination with other refractive errors, which include:  Nearsightedness (myopia). This occurs when the cornea is curved too much or the eye is longer than usual. Instead of being focused precisely on the retina, light is focused in front of the retina, making distant objects seem blurry. Farsightedness (hyperopia). This occurs when the cornea is curved too little or the eye is shorter than usual. The effect is the opposite of nearsightedness. When the eye is in a relaxed state, light never comes to a focus at the back of the eye, making nearby objects seem blurry."

Symptoms include fatigue, heart palpitations, trouble breathing and dizziness. Afib is one of the most common arrhythmias. Risk factors include high blood pressure, coronary artery disease and having obesity. Untreated Afib can lead to a stroke.  Contents Overview Symptoms and Causes Diagnosis and Tests Management and Treatment Prevention Living With Contents Overview Symptoms and Causes Diagnosis and Tests Management and Treatment Prevention Living With Overview What is atrial fibrillation? Atrial fibrillation (also called Afib or AF) is an irregular heart rhythm (arrhythmia) that begins in the upper (atria) of your heart. If you have atrial fibrillation, the normal cycle of electrical impulses in your heart is interrupted. This leads to a fast, chaotic heart rhythm and poor movement of blood from your atria to your lower chambers (ventricles).  There are three main types of atrial fibrillation.  Paroxysmal Afib lasts less than one week and usually stops on its own without treatment. (Paroxysmal is pronounced par-ək-ˈsiz-məl.) Persistent Afib lasts more than one week and needs treatment. Long-standing persistent Afib lasts more than a year and is sometimes difficult to treat. Afib, if untreated, can lead to a stroke and other serious medical complications. That’s why it’s important to learn the symptoms and talk with your healthcare provider about your personal risk factors.  What are the symptoms of atrial fibrillation? You might be wondering what Afib feels like. Some people with Afib have no symptoms. It depends on how fast your ventricles are beating. If they’re beating at a normal or slightly elevated pace, you probably won’t feel anything. But if your ventricles beat faster then you’ll start to notice symptoms. These can include:  Extreme fatigue. An irregular heartbeat. Heart palpitations. A feeling of butterflies or a fish flopping in your chest. Dizziness or lightheadedness. Fainting (syncope). Shortness of breath (dyspnea). Chest pain (angina). If you have symptoms, keep a list of when they happen and share this information with your healthcare provider right away.  How can I check for Afib at home? If you think you have Afib symptoms, it’s important to call your healthcare provider right away to discuss how you’re feeling. Your provider may ask you to check your pulse. If it feels erratic or weak, that could be a sign you’re in Afib.However, sometimes you might not notice any changes in your pulse, especially if your Afib isn’t advanced. You may instead just feel tired or out of breath. You may not know if your symptoms are from Afib or something else. That’s why a call to your provider is essential.  When should I call 911? Atrial fibrillation can cause serious medical complications. So, it’s essential to learn the warning signs and to share them with your family and friends. In many cases, we need someone else to call 911 for us. Immediately call 911 (or your local emergency services) if you have the following symptoms or if you notice them in someone around you:  Signs of bleeding Bright red blood in your vomit, stool, or urine. Severe pain in your head or abdomen. Drastic vision changes. Difficulty moving your legs or arms. Memory loss. These are signs of bleeding in your brain, digestive system, or urinary tract. Many people with Afib need to take blood-thinning medications to lower the risk of Afib-related stroke. This medication is essential. But taking too high a dose can cause bleeding in your body.  Heart attack symptoms Pain, discomfort or pressure in the center of your chest or upper abdomen (it could come and go, or persist). A feeling of squeezing, fullness, heartburn or indigestion. Pain down your left arm. People assigned female at birth may also have:  Nausea and vomiting. Shortness of breath. Excessive tiredness. Pain in the back, shoulders or jaw. Stroke symptoms Sudden numbness or weakness on one side of your body. Confusion or trouble speaking or understanding others. Difficulty seeing in one or both of your eyes. Trouble walking. Feeling dizzy or off-balance. Sudden headache for no reason. These are signs you may be having a stroke. Learn how to recognize these symptoms in yourself or others so you can act quickly. Every minute counts.  Signs of cardiac arrest Chest pain (angina). Shortness of breath. Nausea and vomiting. Feeling dizzy or lightheaded. These symptoms can happen within an hour before having a cardiac arrest. In some cases, these symptoms might not appear at all, and a person could simply faint. If you or a loved one have Afib, it’s a good idea to talk with your healthcare provider about how to get help in medical emergencies. For those who live alone or spend lots of time alone, there may be no one home to call for help. Medical alert devices may be a life-saving resource.  How does atrial fibrillation affect my body? When you’re in Afib, your heart’s electrical system isn’t working as it should. Your electrical impulses are chaotic, leading to an irregular and rapid heartbeat. When you feel your pulse isn’t right, you might wonder what’s going on inside your heart. It’s helpful to learn more about the differences between a normal heartbeat and what happens when you’re in Afib.  How your heart normally works Your heart pumps blood to the rest of your body. During each heartbeat, your two atria contract, followed by your two lower chambers (ventricles). These actions, when timed perfectly, allow your heart to work as an efficient pump. Your heart’s electrical system controls the timing of your heart’s contractions. And your sinoatrial (SA) node is normally in charge of that electrical system. This node is located in your right atrium. When your SA node fires an impulse, electrical activity spreads through your right and left atria (“atrium” is singular and “atria” is plural). Both atria then contract and force blood into your ventricles.  The impulse then travels to the atrioventricular (AV) node, located near the middle of your heart. From there, the impulse moves to your ventricles, causing them to contract and pump blood out of your heart to your lungs and the rest of your body. This process repeats with every heartbeat. The SA node directs the timing of the electrical impulses and keeps your heart pumping smoothly.  You can think of your SA node as the conductor of an orchestra. Your SA node is responsible for keeping your heart beating at the proper pace and rhythm. Likewise, an orchestra conductor directs all the musicians to keep the music flowing at the right tempo, sometimes faster and sometimes slower.  Normally, your SA node adjusts to your level of activity. For example, it increases the rate of impulses when you exercise and decreases the rate when you sleep. With the SA node conducting your heart’s rhythm, you are in “normal sinus rhythm.” This means your heart is beating at a regular rhythm and pace, about 60 to 100 times per minute.  What happens when you’re in Afib If you have atrial fibrillation, your SA node isn’t directing your heart’s electrical rhythm. Instead, many different impulses rapidly fire at the same time, causing a fast, chaotic rhythm in your atria. As a result, your atria can’t contract or pump blood effectively into your ventricles. Your ventricles contract irregularly, causing a rapid irregular heartbeat.  It’s as if in the middle of a concert, two more conductors walked onto the stage and started waving their batons. The musicians would no longer know who to follow or what to do. The music would lose its rhythm and harmony.  Fortunately, there are many ways to bring back your heart’s rhythm and harmony if you have Afib. It all starts with a visit to your healthcare provider, who can run some tests and make a diagnosis.  How common is atrial fibrillation? Some researchers have called Afib the “new cardiovascular disease epidemic of the 21st century.” Afib is especially common among older adults. Over 33 million people age 55+ have been diagnosed globally. Estimates predict that 12 million people in the U.S. will have Afib by 2030. Afib causes nearly half a million yearly hospitalizations in the U.S. and leads to more and more deaths with each passing year.  Who does atrial fibrillation affect? While Afib can affect anyone, it’s more common among people of European descent. However, Black people who have Afib are more likely to have serious complications such as stroke or heart failure. People assigned female at birth (AFAB) are more commonly diagnosed than people assigned male at birth (AMAB).  Symptoms and Causes What causes atrial fibrillation to start? Changes or damage to your heart’s tissue and electrical system cause atrial fibrillation. Usually, coronary artery disease or high blood pressure causes those changes. Often a trigger heartbeat causes atrial fibrillation to begin. But sometimes it’s hard to know the cause of that triggered heartbeat. For some people, there is no identifiable cause. Research is constantly providing new information to help us learn more about the  Afib often runs in families. So, if a close family member has Afib, you have a “family history” and therefore a higher chance of developing it, too.  Can atrial fibrillation be caused by anxiety? We don’t fully know the connections between atrial fibrillation and anxiety. Research has identified Afib as a cause of anxiety (if you have Afib, you might worry about your symptoms or quality of life). But few studies have explored anxiety as a cause of Afib. We do know that anxiety can raise your risk of cardiovascular disease and causes a 48% higher risk of cardiac death. However, we need more research to find out if anxiety disorders can cause Afib.  Diagnosis and Tests How is atrial fibrillation diagnosed? To diagnose atrial fibrillation, your healthcare provider will first ask you some questions. You’ll share information about your diet and physical activity, family history, any symptoms you’ve noticed and risk factors. It’s OK if you don’t know all the answers but share as much as you can. Your experiences and knowledge are essential tools to help your provider make a diagnosis. Your provider will then give you a physical exam that includes:  Listening to your heart rhythm with a stethoscope. Checking your pulse and blood pressure. Checking the size of your thyroid gland to identify thyroid problems. Looking for swelling in your feet or legs to identify heart failure. Listening to your lungs to detect heart failure or infection. This exam will help your provider understand your baseline health and how your body is functioning.  Tests to diagnose atrial fibrillation In addition to the physical exam, your provider may run some tests to make an atrial fibrillation diagnosis. These tests include:  Electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG). An EKG is usually the first test. It’s painless and takes about three minutes. It measures and records your heart’s electrical signals and allows your provider to see if your heart is beating normally. Echocardiogram (echo). An echo uses ultrasound technology to show your heart’s movement. It can reveal problems with blood flow and heart muscle contractions. Blood tests. Sometimes, imbalances in our blood can cause Afib. Simple blood tests can show your potassium and thyroid hormone levels and can help your provider choose the best medicines for you based on your liver and kidney function. In some cases, your provider may want to check how your heart works in your daily life. If so, you’ll be asked to wear a Holter monitor (for one or two days) or a portable event monitor (for up to one month) to record your heart’s activity.  An EKG looks different for someone who has atrial fibrillation. There are small, irregular waves in between the heartbeats. An EKG records your heart’s electrical impulses and can show if you have atrial fibrillation.  Management and Treatment What are the treatments for atrial fibrillation? The main goals of Afib treatment include:  Controlling your heart rate. Regaining a normal heart rhythm. Reducing your risk of having a stroke. Based on your symptoms, your healthcare provider will likely first prescribe medications to see if they help.  Medications Medications to treat Afib may include:  Rate control medications to prevent the ventricles from beating too fast. Examples include digoxin, metoprolol, verapamil or diltiazem. Rhythm control medications to help your heart beat in a normal sinus rhythm. Examples include procainamide, disopyramide, flecainide acetate, propafenone, sotalol, dofetilide or amiodarone. Blood thinners (anticoagulant medications) to reduce the risk of blood clots and stroke. Examples include warfarin, warfarin alternatives or aspirin. Any medications can cause side effects. Rate control and rhythm control medications may make your arrhythmia worse or impact your lungs, liver or other organs. Blood thinners can cause bleeding, indigestion or a heart attack. Usually, the benefits of taking these medications outweigh your risk of side effects. It’s important to discuss all risks and side effects with your provider.  Procedures and surgeries If medications don’t help your Afib, you may need a procedure or surgery.  Electrical cardioversion electrically “resets” your heart rhythm using low-energy shocks, but it may only be a temporary solution. Pulmonary vein ablation uses catheters to deliver energy outside and around your pulmonary veins. This procedure helps you respond better to your Afib medications. You may not even need medications long-term. A permanent pacemaker may be inserted if you have a slow heart rate. Usually, it’s only used if you have another arrhythmia in addition to Afib. Left atrial appendage closure is a procedure that reduces your risk of blood clots and stroke. The MAZE procedure creates scar tissue that helps your heart’s electrical impulses travel in the right path. This procedure has a high success rate. If you have severe Afib symptoms and a history of stroke or blood clots, your provider may recommend this option. Many procedures can be non-invasive, and newer treatment methods and technologies are constantly developing. Talk with your provider about the options that are best for you.  Can Afib go away? If you have paroxysmal Afib, your symptoms may go away on their own without treatment. However, paroxysmal Afib can progress to persistent Afib depending on your risk factors. And both persistent Afib and long-standing persistent Afib require treatment to avoid serious complications. As Afib progresses, it becomes more serious and harder to treat. Afib can’t be cured, but its symptoms can be managed. Talk with your healthcare provider about the management and treatment plan that’s best for you.  Prevention What are the risk factors for atrial fibrillation? The older we get, the greater our risk for atrial fibrillation. When we hit 65, our risk especially increases. Besides increasing age, high blood pressure is a huge risk factor. High blood pressure causes 1 in 5 cases of Afib. You also have a higher risk of developing Afib if you have any of the following conditions:  Obesity. Type 2 diabetes. Heart failure. Coronary artery disease. Congenital heart disease. Lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Sleep apnea. Hyperthyroidism. In addition, certain lifestyle factors like smoking, alcohol consumption and recreational drug use can raise your risk.  While exercise strengthens your heart, some athletes who exercise intensely for long periods of time could have a higher risk of Afib. In such cases, reducing the exercise intensity usually helps.  An estimated 1 in 3 people with Afib don’t know they have it. That’s why it’s important to know the risk factors and talk with your healthcare provider. If you’re at risk, you should have your heart and pulse checked regularly so you can catch problems early.  How can I reduce my risk of developing atrial fibrillation? If you have other medical conditions or a family history of Afib, you may feel like it’s impossible to prevent. It’s true that some risk factors can’t be changed. However, the four major risk factors for Afib that we can change are obesity, physical inactivity, excessive alcohol consumption and tobacco use. Here are some tips to lower your risk:  Follow a heart-healthy diet. Add aerobic exercise to your routine. Try for at least 150 minutes per week. Learn the target heart rate for your age and monitor your heart rate throughout exercise. Be sure to talk with your provider before starting any exercise plan. Limit your alcohol consumption. Quit smoking and using tobacco products. It can be hard to do this alone. With the right resources and support, you can achieve this goal and make your heart healthier. As you lower these risk factors, you will also see other benefits like reduced blood pressure, lower cholesterol levels and weight loss. When it comes to heart health, each positive lifestyle change has a ripple effect. The more changes you can make, the more benefits you will enjoy in the long run.  Living With When should I see my healthcare provider? There’s no single schedule to follow. It all depends on your symptoms and treatment plan, and whether you need follow-ups after a procedure. So, it’s important to talk with your provider and make a plan together. Make sure you go to all your scheduled appointments. Keep track of the medications you’re taking, and bring a list of your medications to every appointment. It’s also a good idea to keep the list in your wallet so it’s with you in emergencies.  What should I discuss with my healthcare provider? At each visit, be sure to share any new symptoms or problems you’re having, such as side effects from medication.  Your provider will ask you questions, but it’s important to ask your own questions, too. For example, ask for advice on how to reduce your risk factors. Starting a new diet or exercise plan can feel overwhelming. Your provider will offer advice and also connect you with others who can help, such as dietitians. You may also want to ask about available health and fitness programs, including those that support your mind-body connection.  Finally, be sure to ask your provider before taking over-the-counter medicines, such as those for cold and flu, and nutritional supplements. Sometimes these products can affect your heart rate or interact with your prescription medications.  A note from Cleveland Clinic  Atrial fibrillation is a complex heart condition that can seem scary, confusing or overwhelming. But whether you suspect you might have Afib, were recently diagnosed or have been living with it for years, you’re not alone. You’re one of the millions of people who are learning new strategies for managing Afib while still enjoying life. That’s why it’s important to talk with your healthcare provider and learn more about available resources and support communities.  It’s also helpful to learn about the benefits and risks of treatment options. All medications or procedures carry some risks. But when it comes to Afib, treatment is essential for supporting your heart and reducing your chances of having a stroke. Your provider will work with you to choose the best approach. With treatment, monitoring and lifestyle changes, you can live a long and healthy life with Afib."

An irregular heart rhythm is called an arrhythmia. AFib can lead to blood clots in the heart. The condition also increases the risk of stroke, heart failure and other heart-related complications.  During atrial fibrillation, the heart's upper chambers — called the atria — beat chaotically and irregularly. They beat out of sync with the lower heart chambers, called the ventricles. For many people, AFib may have no symptoms. But AFib may cause a fast, pounding heartbeat, shortness of breath or light-headedness.  Episodes of atrial fibrillation may come and go, or they may be persistent. AFib itself usually isn't life-threatening. But it's a serious medical condition that needs proper treatment to prevent stroke.  Treatment for atrial fibrillation may include medicines, therapy to shock the heart back to a regular rhythm and procedures to block faulty heart signals.  A person with atrial fibrillation also may have a related heart rhythm problem called atrial flutter. The treatments for AFib and atrial flutter are similar.  Products & Services A Book: Future Care Show more products from Mayo Clinic Symptoms Symptoms of AFib may include:  Feelings of a fast, fluttering or pounding heartbeat, called palpitations. Chest pain. Dizziness. Fatigue. Lightheadedness. Reduced ability to exercise. Shortness of breath. Weakness. Some people with atrial fibrillation (AFib) don't notice any symptoms.  Atrial fibrillation may be:  Occasional, also called paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. AFib symptoms come and go. The symptoms usually last for a few minutes to hours. Some people have symptoms for as long as a week. The episodes can happen repeatedly. Symptoms might go away on their own. Some people with occasional AFib need treatment. Persistent. The irregular heartbeat is constant. The heart rhythm does not reset on its own. If symptoms occur, medical treatment is needed to correct the heart rhythm. Long-standing persistent. This type of AFib is constant and lasts longer than 12 months. Medicines or a procedure are needed to correct the irregular heartbeat. Permanent. In this type of atrial fibrillation, the irregular heart rhythm can't be reset. Medicines are needed to control the heart rate and to prevent blood clots. When to see a doctor If you have symptoms of atrial fibrillation, make an appointment for a health checkup. You may be referred to a doctor trained in heart diseases, called a cardiologist.  If you have chest pain, seek immediate medical help. Chest pain could mean that you're having a heart attack.

Causes To understand the causes of atrial fibrillation (AFib), it may be helpful to know how the heart typically beats.  The heart has four chambers:  The two upper chambers are called the atria. The two lower chambers are called the ventricles. Inside the upper right heart chamber is a group of cells called the sinus node. The sinus node makes the signals that starts each heartbeat.  The signals move across the upper heart chambers. Next, the signals arrive at a group of cells called the AV node, where they usually slow down. The signals then go to the lower heart chambers.  In a healthy heart, this signaling process usually goes smoothly. The resting heart rate is typically 60 to 100 beats a minute.  But in atrial fibrillation, the signals in the upper chambers of the heart are chaotic. As a result, the upper chambers tremble or shake. The AV node is flooded with signals trying to get through to the lower heart chambers. This causes a fast and irregular heart rhythm.  In people with AFib, the heart rate may range from 100 to 175 beats a minute.  Causes of atrial fibrillation Problems with the heart's structure are the most common cause of atrial fibrillation (AFib).  Heart diseases and health problems that can cause AFib include:  A heart problem you're born with, called a congenital heart defect. A problem with the heart's natural pacemaker, called sick sinus syndrome. A sleep disorder called obstructive sleep apnea. Heart attack. Heart valve disease. High blood pressure. Lung diseases, including pneumonia. Narrowed or blocked arteries, called coronary artery disease. Thyroid disease such as an overactive thyroid. Infections from viruses. Heart surgery or stress due to surgery or sickness may also cause AFib. Some people who have atrial fibrillation have no known heart disease or heart damage.  Lifestyle habits that can trigger an AFib episode may include:  Drinking too much alcohol or caffeine. Illegal drug use. Smoking or using tobacco. Taking medicines that contain stimulants, including cold and allergy medicines bought without a prescription. Risk factors Things that can increase the risk of atrial fibrillation (AFib) include:  Age. The risk of AFib increases as you grow older. Caffeine, nicotine or illegal drug use. Caffeine, nicotine and some illegal drugs — such as amphetamines and cocaine — can cause your heart to beat faster. Use of these substances may lead to the development of more-serious arrhythmias. Drinking too much alcohol. Drinking too much alcohol can affect the electrical signals in the heart. This can increase the risk of atrial fibrillation. Changes in the level of body minerals. Minerals in the blood called electrolytes — such as potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium — help the heart beat. If these substances are too low or too high, irregular heartbeats may occur. Family history. An increased risk of atrial fibrillation occurs in some families. Heart problems or heart surgery. Coronary artery disease, heart valve disease and heart problems present at birth increase the risk of AFib. A history of heart attack or heart surgery also makes a person more likely to get the condition. High blood pressure. Having high blood pressure increases the risk of getting coronary artery disease. Over time, high blood pressure may cause part of the heart to become stiff and thick. This can change how heartbeat signals travel through the heart. Obesity. People who have obesity are at higher risk of developing atrial fibrillation. Other long-term health conditions. You may be more likely to get AFib if you have diabetes, chronic kidney disease, lung disease or sleep apnea. Some medicines and supplements. Some prescription medicines and certain cough and cold remedies bought without a prescription can cause irregular heartbeats. Thyroid disease. Having an overactive thyroid gland can raise the risk of irregular heartbeats. Complications Blood clots are a dangerous complication of atrial fibrillation (AFib). Blood clots can lead to stroke.  The risk of stroke from AFib increases as you grow older. Other health conditions also may increase the risk of a stroke due to AFib. These conditions include:  High blood pressure. Diabetes. Heart failure. Some types of heart valve disease. Blood thinners are commonly prescribed to prevent blood clots and strokes in people with atrial fibrillation.  Prevention Healthy lifestyle choices can reduce the risk of heart disease and may prevent atrial fibrillation (AFib). Here are some basic heart-healthy tips:  Control high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes. Don't smoke or use tobacco. Eat a diet that's low in salt and saturated fat. Exercise at least 30 minutes a day on most days of the week unless your health care team says not to. Get good sleep. Adults should aim for 7 to 9 hours daily. Maintain a healthy weight. Reduce and manage stress." 
python3 medical_database/SpacyParse.py -s "https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/21214-coronavirus-covid-19  Coronavirus, COVID-19 COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. COVID-19 can cause mild to severe respiratory illness, including death. The best preventive measures include getting vaccinated, wearing a mask during times of high transmission, staying 6 feet apart, washing hands often and avoiding sick people.  Contents Overview Symptoms and Causes Diagnosis and Tests Management and Treatment Prevention Contents Overview Symptoms and Causes Diagnosis and Tests Management and Treatment Prevention Overview Microscopic rendering of Coronavirus, a virus identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a virus identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness. What is coronavirus? Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that can cause respiratory illness in humans. They are called “corona” because of crown-like spikes on the surface of the virus. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and the common cold are examples of coronaviruses that cause illness in humans.  The new strain of coronavirus — SARS-CoV-2 — was first reported in Wuhan, China in December 2019. It has since spread to every country around the world.  Where do coronaviruses come from? Coronaviruses are often found in bats, cats and camels. The viruses live in but don’t infect the animals. Sometimes these viruses then spread to different animal species. The viruses may change (mutate) as they transfer to other species. Eventually, the virus can jump from animal species and begin to infect humans. In the case of SARS-CoV-19, the first people infected are thought to have contracted the virus at a food market that sold meat, fish and live animals.  How do you get COVID-19? SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, enters your body through your mouth, nose or eyes (directly from the airborne droplets or from the transfer of the virus from your hands to your face). It then travels to the back of your nasal passages and mucous membrane in the back of your throat. It attaches to cells there, begins to multiply and moves into lung tissue. From there, the virus can spread to other body tissues.  How does the new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) spread from person to person? Coronavirus is likely spread:  The virus travels in respiratory droplets released into the air when an infected person coughs, sneezes, talks, sings or breathes near you. You may be infected if you inhale these droplets. You can also get coronavirus from close contact (touching, shaking hands) with an infected person and then touching your face. How long is a person with COVID-19 considered contagious? If you have COVID-19 it can take several days to develop symptoms — but you’re contagious during this time. You are no longer contagious 10 days after your symptoms began.  The best way to avoid spreading COVID-19 to others is to:  Stay 6 feet away from others whenever possible. Wear a cloth mask that covers your mouth and nose when around others. Wash your hands often. If soap isn’t available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Avoid crowded indoor spaces. Open windows to bring in outdoor air as much as possible. Stay self-isolated at home if you are feeling ill with symptoms that could be COVID-19 or have a positive test for COVID-19. Clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces. Who’s most at risk for getting COVID-19? Persons at greatest risk of contracting COVID-19 include those who:  Live in or have recently traveled to any area with ongoing active spread. Have had close contact with a person who has a laboratory-confirmed or a suspected case of the COVID-19 virus. Close contact is defined as being within 6 feet of an infected person for a cumulative total of 15 minutes or more over a 24-hour period. Are over the age of 60 with pre-existing medical conditions or a weakened immune system. How soon after becoming infected with SARS-CoV-2 will I develop COVID-19 symptoms? The time between becoming infected and showing symptoms (incubation period) can range from two to 14 days. The average time before experiencing symptoms is five days. Symptoms can range in severity from very mild to severe. In about 80% of people, COVID-19 causes only mild symptoms, although this may change as variants emerge.  If I recover from a case of COVID-19, can I be infected again? If you test positive for SARS-CoV-2 three months after your last positive test, it’s considered a reinfection. Before the omicron variant, reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 was rare but possible.  Omicron (B.1.1.529) was first reported in South Africa in November 2021 and quickly spread around the world. With many mutations, omicron was able to evade immune systems and we had more reinfections than ever before.  As the virus that causes COVID-19 continues to mutate, reinfection remains possible. Vaccination — including a booster dose — is the best protection against severe disease.  Symptoms and Causes What are the symptoms of COVID-19? COVID-19 symptoms vary from person to person. In fact, some infected people don’t develop any symptoms (asymptomatic). In general, people with COVID-19 report some of the following symptoms:  Fever or chills. Cough. Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. Tiredness. Muscle or body aches. Headaches. New loss of taste or smell. Sore throat. Congestion or runny nose. Nausea or vomiting. Diarrhea. Additional symptoms are possible.  Symptoms may appear two to 14 days after exposure to the virus. Children have similar, but usually milder, symptoms than adults. Older adults and people who have severe underlying medical conditions are at higher risk of more serious complication from COVID-19.  Call 911 and get immediate medical attention if you have these warning signs:  Trouble breathing. Persistent pain or pressure in your chest. New confusion. Inability to wake up from sleep. Bluish lips or face. This list does not include all possible symptoms. Contact your healthcare provider if you’re concerned you may have coronavirus or have any severe symptoms.  Diagnosis and Tests How is coronavirus diagnosed? COVID-19 is diagnosed with a laboratory test. Your healthcare provider may collect a sample of your saliva or swab your nose or throat to send for testing.  When should I be tested for the coronavirus (COVID-19)? Call your healthcare provider if you:  Feel sick with fever, cough or have difficulty breathing. Have been in close contact with a person known or suspected to have COVID-19. Your healthcare provider will ask you questions about your symptoms and tell you if you need to be tested for COVID-19.  If I have a positive test for coronavirus, how long should I self-isolate? According to current CDC recommendations, you should self-isolate until you've met both of the following criteria:  It's been five days since your symptoms first appeared and your symptoms are improving. You've not had a fever for 24 hours and you've not used fever-lowing medications during this time. While at home, self-isolate within a separate room of your home if possible to limit interaction with other family members. If you can’t stay 100% isolated in a separate room, keep 6 feet away from others and wear a cloth mask, wash your/family members' hands often and frequently disinfect commonly touched surfaces and shared areas.  You don't need to be retested after your period of self-isolation. But every case is unique, so follow your healthcare provider's recommendations for testing.  If you have a weakened immune system or have had a severe case of COVID-19, the CDC's criteria don’t apply to you. You may need to stay home for up to 20 days after your symptoms first appeared. Talk with your healthcare provider about your situation.  How long do I need to isolate myself if I’ve been around a person with COVID-19? You should quarantine for five days if:  You haven’t been fully vaccinated. More than six months have gone by since your second vaccine dose and you haven’t been boosted. After this time, you should wear a well-fitting mask whenever you’re around others for an additional five days. The CDC recommends testing on day five if possible. This quarantine period may vary depending on variant strains and the availability of testing.  Is it possible to test negative for coronavirus and still be infected with it? Yes, it’s possible. There are several reasons for “false negative” test results — meaning you really do have COVID-19 although the test result says you don’t.  Reasons for a false negative COVID-19 test result include:  You were tested too early in the course of illness. The virus hasn’t multiplied in your body to the level that it could be detected by the test. The swab didn’t get a good specimen. You or the healthcare personnel may not have swabbed deeply enough in your nasal cavity to collect a good sample. There could also be less likely handling errors and transportation errors. The test itself was not sensitive or specific enough to detect SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Sensitivity refers to the ability of the test to detect the smallest amount of virus. Specificity refers to the ability of the test to detect only the COVID-19 virus and not other similar viruses. Many different commercial and hospital laboratories have developed tests for SARS-CoV-2. All must meet standards, but there’s always the possibility of “false negative” and “false positive” tests. If you think you might have COVID-19 even if your test is negative, it’s best to follow the current CDC recommendations. Stay home for 10 days if you think you are sick (“social distancing”). Stay 6 feet away from others (“physical distancing”) and wear a cloth mask. Contact your healthcare provider if your symptoms worsen. Don’t decide on your own if it’s safe for you to be around others. Instead, contact your healthcare provider when your symptoms improve.  Management and Treatment What treatments do people receive if they have COVID-19? Treatments for COVID-19 vary depending on the severity of your symptoms. If you’re not in the hospital or don’t need supplemental oxygen, no specific antiviral or immunotherapy is recommended.  Depending on the severity of your COVID symptoms, you may need:  Supplemental oxygen (given through tubing inserted into your nostrils). Some people may benefit from an infusion of monoclonal antibodies. Antiviral medications may reduce the risk of hospitalization and death in certain patients with COVID-19. Mechanical ventilation (oxygen through a tube inserted down your trachea). You are given medications to keep you comfortable and sleepy as long as you’re receiving oxygen through a ventilator. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). You continue to receive treatment while a machine pumps your blood outside your body. It takes over the function of your body’s lungs and heart. Can vaccinated people still get COVID-19? Yes, it’s possible to get COVID-19 even if you’ve been vaccinated. No vaccines are 100% effective. In fact, breakthrough cases (when someone tests positive more than two weeks after they're fully vaccinated) are expected, especially as the SARS-CoV-2 virus mutates.  The vaccines significantly reduce — but don’t eliminate — your risk of infection. The risk of a severe illness or death from a breakthrough infection is very low.  How can I manage my symptoms at home? If you have mild COVID-19 symptoms, you can likely manage your health at home. Follow these tips:  If you have a fever, drink plenty of fluids (water is best), get lots of rest and take acetaminophen (Tylenol®). If you have a cough, lie on your side or sit up (don’t lie on your back). Add a teaspoon of honey to your hot tea or hot water (don’t give honey to children under 1 year of age). Gargle with salt water. Call your healthcare provider or pharmacist for advice about over-the-counter, comfort care products like cough suppressants and cough drops/lozenges. Have a friend or family member pick up any needed medicines. You must stay at home. If you’re anxious about your breathing, try to relax. Take slow deep breaths in through your nose and slowly release through pursed lips (like you’re are slowly blowing out a candle). If you’re having trouble breathing, call 911. If you have a mild case of COVID-19, you should start to feel better in a few days to a week. If you think your symptoms are getting worse, call your healthcare provider.  Prevention How can I keep from getting COVID-19? The best defense to prevent getting COVID-19 is to get vaccinated. You should also follow the same steps you would take to prevent getting other viruses, such as the common cold or the flu.  Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds — especially before eating and preparing food, after using the bathroom, after wiping your nose, and after coming in contact with someone who has a cold. Wear a multilayered cloth facemask that fits snugly on your face and covers your mouth, nose and chin as recommended by the CDC. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth to prevent the spread of viruses from your hands. Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when sneezing and coughing or sneeze and cough into your sleeve. Throw the tissue in the trash. Wash your hands afterward. Never cough or sneeze into your hands! Avoid close contact (within 6 feet) with those who have coughs, colds or are sick. Stay home if you’re sick. If you’re prone to sickness or have a weakened immune system, stay away from large crowds of people. Follow the directions of your healthcare authorities, especially during outbreaks. Clean frequently used surfaces (such as doorknobs and countertops) with a virus-killing disinfectant. Use hand sanitizers that contain at least 60% alcohol if soap and water are not available. Greet people with a friendly gesture instead of shaking hands. Get enough sleep, eat a healthy diet, drink plenty of liquids and exercise if you are able. These steps will strengthen your immune system and help you fight off infections more easily. Should I wear a face mask? Your healthcare provider can answer any questions you have about when you should wear a face mask to help slow the transmission of COVID-19. In general, the CDC recommends wearing a face mask in the following situations:  If you’re in an area with high community levels of COVID-19, wear a face mask in public. If you’re sick but can’t avoid being around others. If you’re caring for someone who has COVID-19. If you’re at higher risk for severe illness or live with someone who is. A note from Cleveland Clinic  We’ve come a long way since the first cases of COVID-19 were confirmed in the United States. We’ve learned a lot about the virus and how to treat people who have it. We’ve also greatly increased our ability for testing. You — our communities — have made tremendous efforts to adapt, too.  The changes we’ve all made to stay safe and healthy can feel challenging. But please stay vigilant. We know it’s not easy, but it’s critical. COVID-19 shouldn't be taken lightly. While most people get only mild symptoms, others develop serious complications of the lungs, brain and heart. There may also be other long-term effects that we don’t yet know about.     " 
python3 medical_database/SpacyParse.py -s "https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronavirus/symptoms-causes/syc-20479963  Overview COVID-19, also called coronavirus disease 2019, is an illness caused by a virus. The virus is called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or more commonly, SARS-CoV-2. It started spreading at the end of 2019 and became a pandemic disease in 2020.  Coronavirus Coronavirus Enlarge image The virus that causes COVID-19 spreads most commonly through the air in tiny droplets of fluid between people in close contact. Many people with COVID-19 have no symptoms or mild illness. But for older adults and people with certain medical conditions, COVID-19 can lead to the need for care in the hospital or death.  Staying up to date on your COVID-19 vaccine helps prevent serious illness, the need for hospital care due to COVID-19 and death from COVID-19. Other ways that may help prevent the spread of this coronavirus includes good indoor air flow, physical distancing, wearing a mask in the right setting and good hygiene.  Medicine can limit the seriousness of the viral infection. Most people recover without long-term effects, but some people have symptoms that continue for months.  Products & Services A Book: Endemic - A Post-Pandemic Playbook Show more products from Mayo Clinic Symptoms Typical COVID-19 symptoms often show up 2 to 14 days after contact with the virus.  Symptoms can include:  Dry cough. Shortness of breath. Loss of taste or smell. Extreme tiredness, called fatigue. Digestive symptoms such as upset stomach, vomiting or loose stools, called diarrhea. Pain, such as headaches and body or muscle aches. Fever or chills. Cold-like symptoms such as congestion, runny nose or sore throat. People may only have a few symptoms or none. People who have no symptoms but test positive for COVID-19 are called asymptomatic. For example, many children who test positive don't have symptoms of COVID-19 illness. People who go on to have symptoms are considered presymptomatic. Both groups can still spread COVID-19 to others.  Some people may have symptoms that get worse about 7 to 14 days after symptoms start.  Most people with COVID-19 have mild to moderate symptoms. But COVID-19 can cause serious medical complications and lead to death. Older adults or people who already have medical conditions are at greater risk of serious illness.  COVID-19 may be a mild, moderate, severe or critical illness.  In broad terms, mild COVID-19 doesn't affect the ability of the lungs to get oxygen to the body. In moderate COVID-19 illness, the lungs also work properly but there are signs that the infection is deep in the lungs. Severe COVID-19 means that the lungs don't work correctly, and the person needs oxygen and other medical help in the hospital. Critical COVID-19 illness means the lung and breathing system, called the respiratory system, has failed and there is damage throughout the body. Rarely, people who catch the coronavirus can develop a group of symptoms linked to inflamed organs or tissues. The illness is called multisystem inflammatory syndrome. When children have this illness, it is called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, shortened to MIS-C. In adults, the name is MIS-A.  When to see a doctor Contact a healthcare professional if you test positive for COVID-19. If you have symptoms and need to test for COVID-19, or you've been exposed to someone with COVID-19, a healthcare professional can help.  People who are at high risk of serious illness may get medicine to block the spread of the COVID-19 virus in the body. Or your healthcare team may plan regular checks to monitor your health.  Get emergency help right away for any of these symptoms:  Can't catch your breath or have problems breathing. Skin, lips or nail beds that are pale, gray or blue. New confusion. Trouble staying awake or waking up. Chest pain or pressure that is constant. This list doesn't include every emergency symptom. If you or a person you're taking care of has symptoms that worry you, get help. Let the healthcare team know about a positive test for COVID-19 or symptoms of the illness.

Causes COVID-19 is caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, also called SARS-CoV-2.  The coronavirus spreads mainly from person to person, even from someone who is infected but has no symptoms. When people with COVID-19 cough, sneeze, breathe, sing or talk, their breath may be infected with the COVID-19 virus.  The coronavirus carried by a person's breath can land directly on the face of a nearby person, after a sneeze or cough, for example. The droplets or particles the infected person breathes out could possibly be breathed in by other people if they are close together or in areas with low air flow. And a person may touch a surface that has respiratory droplets and then touch their face with hands that have the coronavirus on them.  It's possible to get COVID-19 more than once.  Over time, the body's defense against the COVID-19 virus can fade. A person may be exposed to so much of the virus that it breaks through their immune defense. As a virus infects a group of people, the virus copies itself. During this process, the genetic code can randomly change in each copy. The changes are called mutations. If the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 changes in ways that make previous infections or vaccination less effective at preventing infection, people can get sick again. The virus that causes COVID-19 can infect some pets. Cats, dogs, hamsters and ferrets have caught this coronavirus and had symptoms. It's rare for a person to get COVID-19 from a pet.  Risk factors The main risk factors for COVID-19 are:  If someone you live with has COVID-19. If you spend time in places with poor air flow and a higher number of people when the virus is spreading. If you spend more than 30 minutes in close contact with someone who has COVID-19. Many factors affect your risk of catching the virus that causes COVID-19. How long you are in contact, if the space has good air flow and your activities all affect the risk. Also, if you or others wear masks, if someone has COVID-19 symptoms and how close you are affects your risk. Close contact includes sitting and talking next to one another, for example, or sharing a car or bedroom.  It seems to be rare for people to catch the virus that causes COVID-19 from an infected surface. While the virus is shed in waste, called stool, COVID-19 infection from places such as a public bathroom is not common.  Serious COVID-19 illness risk factors Some people are at a higher risk of serious COVID-19 illness than others. This includes people age 65 and older as well as babies younger than 6 months. Those age groups have the highest risk of needing hospital care for COVID-19.  Not every risk factor for serious COVID-19 illness is known. People of all ages who have no other medical issues have needed hospital care for COVID-19.  Known risk factors for serious illness include people who have not gotten a COVID-19 vaccine. Serious illness also is a higher risk for people who have:  Sickle cell disease or thalassemia. Serious heart diseases and possibly high blood pressure. Chronic kidney, liver or lung diseases. People with dementia or Alzheimer's also are at higher risk, as are people with brain and nervous system conditions such as stroke. Smoking increases the risk of serious COVID-19 illness. And people with a body mass index in the overweight category or obese category may have a higher risk as well.  Other medical conditions that may raise the risk of serious illness from COVID-19 include:  Cancer or a history of cancer. Type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Weakened immune system from solid organ transplants or bone marrow transplants, some medicines, or HIV. Pregnancy. This list is not complete. Factors linked to a health issue may raise the risk of serious COVID-19 illness too. Examples are a medical condition where people live in a group home, or lack of access to medical care. Also, people with more than one health issue, or people of older age who also have health issues have a higher chance of severe illness.

Complications Complications of COVID-19 include long-term loss of taste and smell, skin rashes, and sores. The illness can cause trouble breathing or pneumonia. Medical issues a person already manages may get worse.  Complications of severe COVID-19 illness can include:  Acute respiratory distress syndrome, when the body's organs do not get enough oxygen. Shock caused by the infection or heart problems. Overreaction of the immune system, called the inflammatory response. Blood clots. Kidney injury. Post-COVID-19 Syndrome After a COVID-19 infection, some people report that symptoms continue for months, or they develop new symptoms. This syndrome has often been called long COVID, or post-COVID-19. You might hear it called long haul COVID-19, post-COVID conditions or PASC. That's short for post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2.  Other infections, such as the flu and polio, can lead to long-term illness. But the virus that causes COVID-19 has only been studied since it began to spread in 2019. So, research into the specific effects of long-term COVID-19 symptoms continues.  Researchers do think that post-COVID-19 syndrome can happen after an illness of any severity.  Getting a COVID-19 vaccine may help prevent post-COVID-19 syndrome.  More Information Long-term effects of COVID-19 Prevention The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends a COVID-19 vaccine for everyone age 6 months and older. The COVID-19 vaccine can lower the risk of death or serious illness caused by COVID-19. It lowers your risk and lowers the risk that you may spread it to people around you.  The COVID-19 vaccines available in the United States are:  2023-2024 Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. This vaccine is available for people age 6 months and older.  Among people with a typical immune system:  Children age 6 months up to age 4 years are up to date after three doses of a Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. People age 5 and older are up to date after one Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. For people who have not had a 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccination, the CDC recommends getting an additional shot of that updated vaccine. 2023-2024 Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. This vaccine is available for people age 6 months and older.  Among people with a typical immune system:  Children ages 6 months up to age 4 are up to date if they've had two doses of a Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. People age 5 and older are up to date with one Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. For people who have not had a 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccination, the CDC recommends getting an additional shot of that updated vaccine. 2023-2024 Novavax COVID-19 vaccine. This vaccine is available for people age 12 years and older.  Among people with a typical immune system:  People age 12 years and older are up to date if they've had two doses of a Novavax COVID-19 vaccine. For people who have not had a 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccination, the CDC recommends getting an additional shot of that updated vaccine. In general, people age 5 and older with typical immune systems can get any vaccine approved or authorized for their age. They usually don't need to get the same vaccine each time.  Some people should get all their vaccine doses from the same vaccine maker, including:  Children ages 6 months to 4 years. People age 5 years and older with weakened immune systems. People age 12 and older who have had one shot of the Novavax vaccine should get the second Novavax shot in the two-dose series. Talk to your healthcare professional if you have any questions about the vaccines for you or your child. Your healthcare team can help you if:  The vaccine you or your child got earlier isn't available. You don't know which vaccine you or your child received. You or your child started a vaccine series but couldn't finish it due to side effects. People with weakened immune systems  Your health care team may suggest added doses of COVID-19 vaccine if you have a moderately or severely weakened immune system.  Control the spread of infection  In addition to vaccination, there are other ways to stop the spread of the virus that causes COVID-19.  If you are at a higher risk of serious illness, talk to your healthcare professional about how best to protect yourself. Know what to do if you get sick so you can quickly start treatment.  If you feel ill or have COVID-19, stay home and away from others, including pets, if possible. Avoid sharing household items such as dishes or towels if you're sick.  In general, make it a habit to:  Test for COVID-19. If you have symptoms of COVID-19 test for the infection. Or test five days after you came in contact with the virus. Help from afar. Avoid close contact with anyone who is sick or has symptoms, if possible. Wash your hands. Wash your hands well and often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Cover your coughs and sneezes. Cough or sneeze into a tissue or your elbow. Then wash your hands. Clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces. For example, clean doorknobs, light switches, electronics and counters regularly. Try to spread out in crowded public areas, especially in places with poor airflow. This is important if you have a higher risk of serious illness.  The CDC recommends that people wear a mask in indoor public spaces if you're in an area with a high number of people with COVID-19 in the hospital. They suggest wearing the most protective mask possible that you'll wear regularly, that fits well and is comfortable.

Also, masks can help if the places you travel to or through have a high level of illness.  Masking is especially important if you or a companion have a high risk of serious illness from COVID-19." 
python3 medical_database/SpacyParse.py -s "https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/popliteal-aneurysm  Popliteal Aneurysm A popliteal aneurysm is an enlarged section of an artery behind your knee. The aneurysm may be on only one side or all around your artery. You may also have one behind your other knee. Many people don’t have symptoms unless their popliteal aneurysms break open or they have blood clots. Open or minimally invasive surgery treats this condition.  Contents Overview Symptoms and Causes Diagnosis and Tests Management and Treatment Prevention Outlook / Prognosis Living With Contents Overview Symptoms and Causes Diagnosis and Tests Management and Treatment Prevention Outlook / Prognosis Living With Overview A popliteal aneurysm is a bulging of the artery behind your knee. A popliteal aneurysm makes the artery behind your knee balloon outward. Symptoms can mean your aneurysm is life-threatening. What is a popliteal aneurysm? A popliteal aneurysm is a ballooned-out part of your popliteal artery, which is behind your knee. Half of the people with popliteal aneurysms will have them in both legs.  Popliteal aneurysms can cause issues if they burst (rupture), send a clot down your leg (embolize) or block artery flow (thrombose). Some people can lose their legs or even their lives when this condition takes a turn for the worse.  How common are they? Popliteal aneurysms happen in 1 in 100,000 people assigned female at birth (AFAB) and 7 in 100,000 people assigned male at birth (AMAB).  Popliteal aneurysms aren’t common, but they’re second only to abdominal aortic aneurysms (the most common kind of aneurysm). These two are related, and nearly half of people with a popliteal aneurysm will also have an abdominal aortic aneurysm. So if a provider finds either aneurysm, it’s important to look for the other.  Symptoms and Causes What are the symptoms of a popliteal aneurysm? Usually, people don’t have any popliteal aneurysm symptoms. However, when symptoms do occur, the aneurysm can be life-threatening. An aneurysm that bursts can cause pain behind your knee, swelling and bruises. When the aneurysm has a clot and some of it escapes down your leg or the aneurysm blocks off completely (thromboses), it can cause a lack of blood flow to your leg. Symptoms of this can be:  Pain. Numbness. Coldness. Muscle weakness. Skin paleness. What causes a popliteal aneurysm? Researchers aren’t sure what causes a popliteal aneurysm. Possible popliteal aneurysm causes include:  Inflammation. Atherosclerosis. Popliteal artery entrapment. Traumatic Injury. What are the risk factors? Popliteal aneurysm risk factors include:  Having a biological family history of aneurysms. Being white. Being older than 50. Being assigned male at birth. Having a connective tissue disorder. Using tobacco products. Having atherosclerosis. What are the complications of a popliteal aneurysm? Complications of a knee aneurysm include:  Blood clot causing a lack of blood flow to your leg. Aneurysm rupture (breakage). Popliteal vein compression. Nerve compression. Diagnosis and Tests How is a popliteal arterial aneurysm diagnosed? Diagnosing a popliteal aneurysm can be difficult. A deep vein thrombosis (DVT) or a Baker’s cyst can appear similarly, so ruling these conditions out is helpful.  To make a popliteal aneurysm diagnosis, a provider will examine the back of your knee. They may be able to see and feel the enlarged artery there and it may throb with your pulse.  A provider may describe your popliteal aneurysm as fusiform (ballooning out all around) or saccular (only one side of your artery balloons out).  What tests will be done to diagnose a popliteal aneurysm? Imaging tests can help a provider make a diagnosis and take measurements for planning a repair.  These tests include:  Duplex ultrasound. Computed tomography angiography (CTA). Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Digital subtraction angiography. If your provider diagnoses a popliteal aneurysm, they’ll most likely check your other leg and your belly (abdomen) for aneurysms, too. This is because many people with popliteal aneurysms have another one in their other legs or in their abdomens. If your provider finds any other aneurysms, they’ll likely need to check them with ultrasound throughout your life.  Management and Treatment When is a popliteal arterial aneurysm treated? Popliteal aneurysm treatment varies depending on your situation. Your risk of an aneurysm breaking open increases when it gets bigger than 2 centimeters (cm) or almost 1 inch around. This is about twice the normal diameter. If your aneurysm has a blood clot in it, a provider may fix it at a smaller size due to the risk of the clot traveling down your leg and causing a blockage of blood flow.  If your popliteal aneurysm is smaller than 2 cm and you don’t have symptoms, a provider will check it regularly to make sure it’s not growing.  Will I need surgery? If you have symptoms with your popliteal aneurysm and/or it’s larger than 2 cm (even without symptoms), a provider will do a popliteal aneurysm repair.  Popliteal aneurysm treatments In open surgery, a provider treats an aneurysm by tying off the artery above and below it (exclusion) and rerouting the blood flow (bypass). Using a piece of your own vein, they restore blood flow from the artery above the aneurysm to the artery below the aneurysm. Then they tie off (ligate) the aneurysm.  A provider sometimes uses an endovascular approach for people with other chronic conditions or issues that may increase the risk of complications with open surgery. In an endovascular approach, a provider puts a covered stent graft inside your artery across the aneurysm. This diverts blood flow from above the aneurysm to below it. Without direct blood flow, the aneurysm can then clot off around the stent.  If you have a blood clot in your leg and it’s causing lack of blood flow, the treatment is different. In this case, a provider may start by placing you on blood thinners (heparin) through an IV. Then they may attempt to re-establish blood flow to your affected leg and foot by performing an angiogram. In some instances, they can try to dissolve the clot with thrombolytics or remove some of the clot with suction devices.  Complications of the treatment Complications of popliteal aneurysm treatment may include:  Blood clots to the leg (embolism). Leg amputation. Stents breaking, moving or not staying open. Bypass grafts occluding. Nerve injury. Deep vein thrombosis. How long does it take to recover from this treatment? After open surgery, you may be in the hospital for two to three days. Recovery time tends to be shorter for an endovascular approach.  Prevention How can I lower my risk of a popliteal aneurysm? Providers believe atherosclerosis is the main cause of a popliteal aneurysm. You may be able to reduce your risk by:  Avoiding tobacco products. Keeping your cholesterol numbers in a normal range. Managing your blood pressure if it’s high. Eating heart-healthy foods that are low in saturated fat. Exercising for 150 minutes each week. Outlook / Prognosis What can I expect if I have a popliteal aneurysm? Even if you don’t have popliteal aneurysm symptoms now, you may in the future. Complications are also likely.  A popliteal aneurysm rarely breaks open. You’re more likely to have a blood clot down your leg instead. If you have endovascular surgery, you may have fewer wound complications than with open surgery. But the repair may not last as long.  Outlook for a popliteal aneurysm Your prognosis (outlook) is good if you get a popliteal aneurysm repair before the issue causes symptoms. Researchers found that after five years, the graft was still open to blood flow in 80% of people who received a bypass graft.  If you have symptoms with your aneurysm, your prognosis is worse.  One study found that a little more than half of those who had surgery for a ruptured popliteal aneurysm were alive one year later.  About 15% of people who get a blood clot in their popliteal aneurysm need a leg amputation.  Living With How do I take care of myself? If you use tobacco products, stopping will improve your health. Also, you can get health benefits from managing these conditions if you have them:  High cholesterol (hyperlipidemia). High blood pressure (hypertension). Diabetes. After surgery, you may need to take antiplatelets (aspirin) to decrease the formation of a clot in your bypass. Keep going to all follow-up appointments with your provider. You’ll need routine evaluations of your bypass to make sure it’s staying open. This is important after surgery as well as during the time that your provider is monitoring the popliteal aneurysm to decide on surgery.  When should I see my healthcare provider? After a popliteal aneurysm repair, you’ll need regular ultrasound checks to make sure your artery bypass is staying open. This is important at one, three, six and 12 months after your operation, but also annually for years to come.  When should I go to the ER? Go to the emergency room if you think your popliteal aneurysm has ruptured or embolized. Signs of this include swelling, bruising, pain, numbness, coolness or difficulty moving your affected leg.  What questions should I ask my healthcare provider? You may want to ask your provider:  What size is my popliteal aneurysm? Do I need surgery? What type of surgery is best for my situation? Do I have a popliteal aneurysm behind my other knee? Do I have an abdominal aortic aneurysm, as well? A note from Cleveland Clinic  It can be stressful knowing that you have a popliteal aneurysm. Talk with your provider about when it’s right to fix your aneurysm and what’s best for you. You have the power to improve your health by avoiding tobacco products and managing your blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Ask your provider if you need help.     " 
python3 medical_database/SpacyParse.py -s "https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/popliteal-artery-aneurysm/symptoms-causes/syc-20355432   Overview A popliteal artery aneurysm is an irregular bulge that occurs in the wall of the artery located behind the knee joint. It is a type of lower extremity aneurysm.  Products & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Family Health Book, 5th Edition Show more products from Mayo Clinic Symptoms You might not notice any symptoms. The first symptom may be pain in the lower leg that occurs with walking, called claudication. Other symptoms of a popliteal artery aneurysm include:  Knee pain. Lower leg pain. Swelling behind the knee. Pulsing feeling behind the knee. Causes An aneurysm is a ballooning in a weak spot in an artery wall. Many different things can cause the popliteal artery wall to become weak, including:  Atherosclerosis. High blood pressure. Wear and tear of the popliteal artery due to repeat use of the knee joint. Risk factors Popliteal artery aneurysms are rare. They are more common in men than in women.  Popliteal artery aneurysm often occurs in men with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). An abdominal aortic aneurysm is a swelling of the wall of the body's main artery, called the aorta. Anyone diagnosed with popliteal artery aneurysm should be screened for AAA.  Other risk factors for popliteal artery aneurysm include:  Growing older. High blood pressure. Smoking. Narrowing of a heart valve. Having three or more aneurysms anywhere in the body. Complications Complications of popliteal artery aneurysm include blood clots. Blood clots can cause a severe lack of blood flow in the lower leg.  A severe lack of blood flow can cause the following symptoms:  A change in skin color in the affected area. No pulse behind the knee. Skin in the affected area feels cold. Numbness in the leg. Inability to move the foot. A severe lack of blood flow may result in loss of the limb. Rarely, the aneurysm may rupture. But the risk of popliteal artery aneurysm rupture is low.  Prevention Smoking and high blood pressure increase the risk of blood vessel problems that can lead to popliteal artery and other aneurysms. Following a heart-healthy lifestyle can help prevent heart disease and blood vessel damage.  Try these heart-healthy tips:  Do not smoke. Eat a nutritious diet. Get regular exercise." 
python3 medical_database/SpacyParse.py -s "https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/4579-sickle-cell-anemia  ADVERTISEMENT Sickle Cell Anemia Sickle cell anemia is a form of the inherited blood disorder, sickle cell disease. Sickle cell anemia changes your red blood cells’ shape, turning round flexible discs into stiff and sticky sickle cells that block blood flow. Thanks to early detection and new treatments, about half of all people who have sickle cell anemia live into their 50s.  Contents Overview Symptoms and Causes Diagnosis and Tests Management and Treatment Prevention Outlook / Prognosis Living With Contents Overview Symptoms and Causes Diagnosis and Tests Management and Treatment Prevention Outlook / Prognosis Living With Overview What is sickle cell anemia? Sickle cell anemia is a form of the inherited blood disorder, sickle cell disease. Sickle cell anemia affects your red blood cells, turning them from round flexible discs into stiff and sticky sickled cells. Sickled cells keep red blood cells from doing their job, which is carrying oxygen throughout your body. Sickled cells also don’t live as long as normal red blood cells. As a result, you don’t have enough healthy red blood cells and you develop anemia, the condition that gives sickle cell anemia its name.  In the past, babies born with sickle cell anemia rarely lived to be adults. Now, thanks to early detection and new treatments, about half of all people who have sickle cell anemia live into their 50s. People who have sickle cell anemia still face potentially life-threatening medical complications. However, healthcare providers have treatments that reduce the risk of complications and ease symptoms when they happen. (Unfortunately, there are many places in the world where people still don’t have access to effective medical treatment for sickle cell anemia.)  Who is affected by sickle cell anemia? Sickle cell anemia is rare in the United States, affecting about around 100,000 people. It mostly affects people whose ancestry links back to parts of the world where many people have malaria and carry a gene that provides partial protection against anemia. This gene also causes sickle cell anemia. In the United States, sickle cell anemia affects many people who are Black. It may also affect people from southern European, Middle Eastern or Asian Indian ancestry.  How does sickle cell anemia affect people? Babies born with sickle cell anemia may not have symptoms for several months. When they do, symptoms include extreme tiredness or fussiness from anemia, painfully swollen hands and feet, and jaundice. Babies may also have spleen damage that affects their immune system and increases their risk for bacterial infections. As people with sickle cell anemia grow older, they may develop different and more serious medical problems that happen when organ tissues don’t receive enough oxygen. People with sickle cell anemia are at increased risk for stroke and lung, kidney, spleen and liver damage.  Symptoms and Causes What causes sickle cell anemia? People with sickle cell anemia inherit the disease from their biological parents. In sickle cell anemia, the gene that helps make normal red blood cells mutates, or changes. People who inherit the mutated hemoglobin protein gene from both biological parents have sickle cell anemia. People who inherit the mutated gene from one biological parent have the sickle cell trait.  How does this mutation affect normal red blood cells? Normal red blood cells contain hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a protein and the main part of red blood cells. When the hemoglobin gene mutates, it creates sickled cells that can’t navigate the network of blood vessels that carry oxygen, nutrients and hormones throughout your body. Here’s why:  Normal hemoglobin is soluble, meaning it dissolves in fluid. Abnormal hemoglobin isn’t as soluble and ends up forming solid clumps in your red blood cells. Red blood cells need to be flexible to squeeze and slide their way through narrow blood vessels. Red blood cells carrying abnormal solid hemoglobin can’t do that. Instead, blood cells with abnormal hemoglobin end up blocking blood vessels and blood flow. Normal red blood cells live about 120 days. Sickled cells self-destruct within 10 to 20 days. Normally, your bone marrow makes enough red blood cells to replace dying cells. When cells die earlier than usual, your bone marrow becomes like a factory struggling to match supply with demand. When the bone marrow factory can’t keep up, you don’t have enough red blood cells. What are the signs and symptoms of medical conditions linked to sickle cell anemia? Sickle cell anemia symptoms typically start when babies are 5 to 6 months old. As they grow older, most people with sickle cell anemia have increased risk for developing new medical conditions. Some of these conditions are life-threatening. But by learning about conditions and symptoms, people with sickle cell anemia can seek help at the first sign of trouble so healthcare providers can treat the condition.  Vaso-inclusive crisis (VOC) Healthcare providers may call this condition acute pain crisis. VOC, or acute pain crises, is the most common reason why people with sickle cell anemia go to the emergency room or need to spend time in the hospital. Symptoms include:  Sudden intense pain. Pain can be sharp or stabbing. VOC may affect any part of your body, but typically affects your abdomen, lower back, arms and legs. Living with VOC is one of the more difficult aspects of having sickle cell anemia. Among other symptoms and complications, people who have sickle cell anemia may feel depressed or anxious because they’re dealing with certain stigmas associated with the condition.  Stigma and sickle cell anemia  Healthcare providers sometimes call VOC the invisible illness because people who are having a pain crisis many times don’t have symptoms other than sudden excruciating pain that’s only eased with opioid painkillers.  Studies show sickle cell anemia carries a stigma linked to people’s need for opioid painkillers to manage VOC. Other studies show people who are members of racial minorities receive less pain medication and have to wait longer for pain medication than people who are white. Combined, these stigmas are a one-two-punch, as sickle cell anemia commonly affects people who are Black or Hispanic.  Acute chest syndrome (ACS) Acute chest syndrome is the most common complication of sickle cell anemia. It’s also the most common cause of death and the second most common cause of hospital admission. It happens when sickled cells clump and clog blood vessels in your lungs. Symptoms include:  Sudden chest pain. Cough. Fever. Trouble breathing. Anemia People who have sickle cell anemia may have mild, moderate or severe forms of anemia. Symptoms include:  Having skin color that’s more pale than usual. Fatigue. This is feeling too tired to manage daily activities. Trouble breathing. In addition to these symptoms, babies with anemia may be unusually fussy or irritable. Children may not grow as fast as other children their age or may enter puberty later than children their age.  Stroke Anyone who has sickle cell anemia is at risk for stroke, including babies. Approximately 11% of people with sickle cell anemia have strokes by age 20, and 24% have strokes by age 45. Here is information on stroke symptoms:  Severe headache. Sudden weakness on one side of your or your child’s body. Change in alertness. Trouble speaking. Trouble seeing. Trouble walking. Splenetic sequestration This happens when sickled cells become stuck in your spleen, forcing your spleen to get larger. Splenic sequestration often causes acute anemia. Symptoms include:  Pain in your upper left belly (abdomen). Sometimes, children’s enlarged spleens are visible or can be felt through their skin. Bacterial infections People with sickle cell anemia have an increased risk for infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and non-Typhi Salmonella species. Symptoms include:  Fever. Coughing. Trouble breathing. Pain in bones. Headaches. Priapism About 35% of all people who are assigned male at birth (AMAB) who have sickle cell anemia develop priapism, or painful erections, that last four hours or more.  Leg ulcers About 2% of people with sickle cell anemia develop leg ulcers, usually after age 10. Leg ulcers are more common in people AMAB and people age 65 and older. Symptoms are painful sores that don’t heal. People often develop these sores on their ankles.  Pulmonary hypertension (PH) About 6% to 11% of people with sickle cell anemia develop pulmonary hypertension (PH). Symptoms include:  Racing pulse. Fainting (passing out) or dizziness. Feeling short of breath during exercise or activity and difficulty breathing when at rest. Chronic kidney disease About 30% of people with sickle cell anemia have chronic kidney disease. Symptoms include:  A need to pee (urinate) more often. Fatigue. Loss of appetite. Swollen hands, feet and ankles. Shortness of breath. Blood in pee (hematuria) or pee that looks foamy. Puffy eyes. Dry and itchy skin (pruritus). Trouble concentrating. Trouble sleeping. Numbness. Nausea or vomiting. Muscle cramps. High blood pressure (hypertension). Skin color that’s noticeably darker than usual. Detached retina Sickled cells can cause detached retinas by blocking blood vessels in your retinas. Common symptoms include:  Seeing flashes of light. Seeing many floaters — flecks, threads, dark spots and squiggly lines that drift across your vision. (Seeing a few here and there is normal and not cause for alarm.) Darkening of your peripheral vision (side vision). Darkening or shadows covering part of your vision. Darkening or shadow covering part of your vision. Diagnosis and Tests How do healthcare providers diagnose sickle cell anemia? Healthcare providers diagnose sickle cell anemia by taking blood samples. They may use a technique called hemoglobin electrophoresis or high-performance liquid chromatography. This test identifies and measures different types of hemoglobin in red blood cells, including the abnormal hemoglobin that causes sickle cell anemia. (Starting in 2007, all babies born in the United States have sickle cell anemia tests right after they’re born. Early diagnosis and treatment are why fewer babies and young children born in the United States die of sickle cell anemia.)  What are the chances that my child will be born with sickle cell anemia? That depends on whether you and/or your partner inherited sickle cell anemia or have sickle cell trait. Sickle cell trait isn’t a disease. People with sickle cell trait have a mixture of normal and abnormal hemoglobin in their red blood cells. They have enough normal hemoglobin in their red blood cells to prevent the cells from sickling. However, they do have an increased risk of having children with sickle cell anemia.  If you and your partner both have sickle cell trait, your child has a 25% chance of being born with sickle cell anemia. If only one of you has sickle cell trait, your child won’t be born with sickle cell anemia, but there’s a 50% chance that your child will be born with sickle cell trait. Studies estimated about 1 to 3 million people in the United States carry sickle cell trait, including about 8% to 10% of people who are Black.  Prenatal screening Healthcare providers can diagnose sickle cell anemia before your baby is born. They do this by taking a sample of the biological mother’s amniotic fluid or tissue from the biological mother’s placenta. Then, they examine the samples for signs of the sickle hemoglobin gene that causes the condition.  Management and Treatment Can healthcare providers cure sickle cell anemia? Right now, allogenic stem cell transplantation is the only way healthcare providers can cure sickle cell anemia and other forms of sickle cell disease. Healthcare providers typically recommend transplantation for people who have severe complications such as stroke, acute chest syndrome or recurring VOC/acute pain crises.  How do healthcare providers treat sickle cell anemia? Healthcare providers typically treat sickle cell anemia with blood transfusions, antibiotics to treat infections and medications that reduce symptoms caused by sickle cell anemia complications. These medications may include hydroxyurea, voxlelotor, L-glutamine therapy and crizanlizumab.  Hydroxyurea (brand names Droxia®, Hydrea ®, Siklos®, Mylocel®) Hydroxyurea (pronounced “hye drox ee ure ee a”) is an anticancer drug now used to treat sickle cell anemia. In 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved hydroxyurea as sickle cell anemia treatment for children age 2 and older, as well as adults. Studies show hydroxyurea:  Cuts the number of VOC/acute pain crises by 50%. Decreases instances of acute chest syndrome. Reduces the need for blood transfusions. Improves anemia symptoms. In children, hydroxyurea eases dactylitis, which causes painful swelling. Voxelotor (brand name Obryta®) This medication prevents red blood cells with abnormal hemoglobin from becoming sickled cells. Voxelotor (pronounced “vox el oh tor”) may prevent some red blood cells from being destroyed faster than your bone marrow can replace them. In 2019, the FDA approved voxelotor for sickle cell disease treatment. In late 2021, the FDA approved voxelotor as treatment for children age 4 and older.  L-glutamine therapy (brand name Endari®) L-glutamine helps reduce some of the complications linked to sickle cell anemia. Sickled cells develop over time. L-glutamine helps protect sickled cells from becoming more misshapen. In 2017, the FDA approved Endari for treatment of children age 5 and older and adults.  Crizanlizumab-tmca (brand name Adakveo®) People with sickle cell anemia cope with sudden bouts of excruciating pain called VOC/acute pain crises. In 2019, the FDA approved crizanlizumab-tmca (pronounced “criz-l-izum-ab”) medication to treat people age 16 and older. This medication may help reduce how often VOC/acute pain crises happen.  Prevention How can I prevent sickle cell anemia? Sickle cell anemia is an inherited disorder. You can have a blood test to find out if you have sickle cell trait that you could pass on to your children. People can have sickle cell trait without having sickle cell disease or sickle anemia.  Outlook / Prognosis What can I expect if I have or my child has sickle cell anemia? Sickle cell anemia is a chronic illness than can’t be cured. There are, however, medications that healthcare providers use to manage sickle cell anemia complications. In some cases, these medications can keep sickle cell anemia from getting worse. Young children may use some of these medications. As children grow up, they may be able to take medications that do more to manage sickle cell anemia complications.  What is the life expectancy for someone who has sickle cell anemia? There was a time when babies born with sickle cell anemia rarely lived past age 5. Now, healthcare providers are able to diagnose sickle cell and begin treatment that eases symptoms and complications. People are living into their 50s with sickle cell anemia. Even so, people who have sickle cell anemia live 20 to 30 years less than people who don’t have the condition.  Living With What’s it like to live with sickle cell anemia? New treatments are helping people with sickle cell anemia live longer and with better quality of life. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has the following suggestions for living well with sickle cell anemia:  Find good medical care. Sickle cell anemia is complicated. Many times, managing sickle cell anemia requires a multidisciplinary team of healthcare providers who specialize in blood disorders. Get regular checkups. Regular health checkups with your primary provider care may head off serious medical complications. Having a relationship with your healthcare provider who understands your situation may make it easier to get help if you have an acute pain crisis. Pay attention to your emotional health. Unfortunately, there are stigmas associated with sickle cell anemia. Sometimes, these stigmas cause people to have depression or anxiety. Talk to your healthcare provider if you’re struggling with emotions related to feeling stigmatized. They can recommend resources to help you. More than that, they may be able to advocate for you by educating peers about sickle cell anemia complications and symptoms. Prevent infections. Talk to your healthcare provider about vaccinations and take steps to protect yourself from infection. Eat a healthy diet. Eat a balanced diet and drink eight to 10 glasses of water every day. Manage your environment. People who have sickle cell anemia need to maintain a balanced body temperature to avoid VOC/acute pain crises, so it’s important that you avoid getting too hot or too cold. Get some exercise. Regular physical activity boosts your mood and your health. But be sure to take it easy, rest when you need to and stay hydrated. Get support. Because sickle cell anemia is a rare disease, most people don’t understand what it’s like to live with it. Ask your healthcare provider for support group suggestions. Look for clinical trials. Healthcare providers and researchers are constantly testing new treatments. Joining a clinical trial may be a way to obtain new medication and treatment. Ask your healthcare provider for help finding a clinical trial. Living with medical complications Sickle cell anemia is a chronic illness with symptoms that change over time. For example, children and adults have to cope with pain from acute chest syndrome or VOCs. They’re at increased risk for stroke. As people grow older, they’re likely to develop new complications such as chronic lung disease and painful leg ulcers.  If you or your child has sickle cell anemia, ask your healthcare provider what you can do now and what you should expect. They’ll likely plan regular tests to monitor signs and symptoms so they can diagnose and treat complications as early as possible.  Managing pain Studies show people with sickle cell anemia are constantly trying to manage pain that many times affects their quality of life. Sometimes, they have acute pain that happens when sickled cells block blood flow. This is VOC and is a medical emergency. Other people have chronic pain — pain that lasts for more than three to six months. If you have chronic pain, consider working with a pain management specialist. They can recommend different ways you can manage pain.  When should I go to the emergency room? Sickle cell anemia may cause serious medical conditions. Go to the emergency room if you have the following symptoms:  Extreme fatigue. Shortness of breath. Dizziness. Irregular heartbeat. Symptoms of acute chest syndrome  Fever of more than 101.3 degrees Fahrenheit (or 38.5 degrees Celsius). Chest pain. Cough. Symptoms of stroke  Sudden weakness. Numbness on one side of your or your child’s body. Confusion. Trouble speaking, seeing or walking. Other symptoms  Painful erections that last four hours or more. This is a symptom of priapism.  A note from Cleveland Clinic  For more than a century, healthcare providers and families struggled with the heartbreaking consequences of babies born with sickle cell anemia. Few babies lived long enough to celebrate their 5th birthdays. Starting about 10 years ago, healthcare providers began making huge strides in treating sickle cells anemia. A baby born now is likely to live well into their 50s. Thanks to research, healthcare providers can treat sickle cell anemia as a chronic illness. But it’s an illness with serious, and sometimes life-threatening, medical complications. If you or your child has sickle cell anemia, you may be grateful for the past progress, but eager about the future. Researchers and healthcare providers are laser-focused on finding a cure for sickle cell anemia." 
python3 medical_database/SpacyParse.py -s "https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/sickle-cell-anemia/symptoms-causes/syc-20355876   Overview Sickle cell anemia is one of a group of inherited disorders known as sickle cell disease. It affects the shape of red blood cells, which carry oxygen to all parts of the body.  Red blood cells are usually round and flexible, so they move easily through blood vessels. In sickle cell anemia, some red blood cells are shaped like sickles or crescent moons. These sickle cells also become rigid and sticky, which can slow or block blood flow.  The current approach to treatment is to relieve pain and help prevent complications of the disease. However, newer treatments may cure people of the disease.  Red blood cells and sickle cells Sickle cell anemia Red blood cells are usually round and flexible. In sickle cell anemia, some red blood cells look like sickles used to cut wheat. These unusually shaped cells give the disease its name.  Products & Services A Book: Mayo Clinic Family Health Book, 5th Edition Newsletter: Mayo Clinic Health Letter — Digital Edition Symptoms Symptoms of sickle cell anemia usually appear around 6 months of age. They vary from person to person and may change over time. Symptoms can include:  Anemia. Sickle cells break apart easily and die. Typical red blood cells usually live for about 120 days before they need to be replaced. But sickle cells usually die in 10 to 20 days, leaving a shortage of red blood cells. This is known as anemia. Without enough red blood cells, the body can't get enough oxygen. This causes fatigue. Episodes of pain. Periodic episodes of extreme pain, called pain crises, are a major symptom of sickle cell anemia. Pain develops when sickle-shaped red blood cells block blood flow through tiny blood vessels to the chest, abdomen and joints.  The pain varies in intensity and can last for a few hours to a few days. Some people have only a few pain crises a year. Others have a dozen or more a year. A severe pain crisis requires a hospital stay.  Some people with sickle cell anemia also have chronic pain from bone and joint damage, ulcers, and other causes.  Swelling of hands and feet. Sickle-shaped red blood cells block blood circulation in the hands and feet, which can cause them to swell. Frequent infections. The spleen is important for protecting against infections. Sickle cells can damage the spleen, raising the risk of developing infections. Babies and children with sickle cell anemia commonly receive vaccinations and antibiotics to prevent potentially life-threatening infections, such as pneumonia. Delayed growth or puberty. Red blood cells provide the body with the oxygen and nutrients needed for growth. A shortage of healthy red blood cells can slow growth in babies and children and delay puberty in teenagers. Vision problems. Tiny blood vessels that supply blood to the eyes can become plugged with sickle cells. This can damage the portion of the eye that processes visual images, called the retina, and lead to vision problems. When to see a doctor See your healthcare professional right away if you or your child has symptoms of sickle cell anemia, including fever or stroke.  Infections often start with a fever and can be life-threatening. Because children with sickle cell anemia are prone to infections, seek prompt medical attention for a fever greater than 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit (38.5 degrees Celsius).  Seek emergency care for symptoms of stroke, which include:  One-sided paralysis or weakness in the face, arms or legs. Confusion. Difficulty walking or talking. Sudden vision changes. Unexplained numbness. Severe headache.

Causes Sickle cell anemia is caused by a change in the gene that tells the body to make hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the iron-rich compound in red blood cells that allows these cells to carry oxygen from the lungs to the rest of the body. The hemoglobin associated with sickle cell anemia causes red blood cells to become rigid, sticky and misshapen.  For a child to have sickle cell anemia, both parents must carry one copy of the sickle cell gene and pass both copies to the child.  If only one parent passes the sickle cell gene to the child, that child will have the sickle cell trait. With one typical hemoglobin gene and one sickle cell gene, people with the sickle cell trait make both typical hemoglobin and sickle cell hemoglobin.  Their blood might contain some sickle cells, but they generally don't have symptoms. They're carriers of the disease. That means they can pass the gene to their children.  Risk factors For a baby to have sickle cell anemia, both parents must carry a sickle cell gene. In the United States, sickle cell anemia most commonly affects people of African, Mediterranean and Middle Eastern descent.  Complications Sickle cell anemia can lead to a host of complications, including:  Stroke. Sickle cells can block blood flow to the brain. Signs of stroke include seizures, weakness or numbness of the arms and legs, sudden speech difficulties, and loss of consciousness. If your child has any of these signs or symptoms, seek medical treatment right away. A stroke can be fatal. Acute chest syndrome. A lung infection or sickle cells blocking blood vessels in the lungs can cause this life-threatening complication. Symptoms include chest pain, fever and difficulty breathing. Acute chest syndrome might need emergency medical treatment. Avascular necrosis. Sickle cells can block the blood vessels that supply blood to the bones. When the bones don't get enough blood, joints may narrow and bones can die. This can happen anywhere but most often happens in the hip. Pulmonary hypertension. People with sickle cell anemia can develop high blood pressure in their lungs. This complication usually affects adults. Shortness of breath and fatigue are common symptoms of this condition, which can be fatal. Organ damage. Sickle cells that block blood flow to organs deprive the affected organs of blood and oxygen. In sickle cell anemia, blood also is low in oxygen. This lack of oxygen-rich blood can damage nerves and organs, including the kidneys, liver and spleen, and can be fatal. Splenic sequestration. Sickle cells can get trapped in the spleen, causing it to enlarge. This may cause abdominal pain on the left side of the body and can be life-threatening. Parents of children with sickle cell anemia can learn how to locate and feel their child's spleen for enlargement. Blindness. Sickle cells can block tiny blood vessels that supply blood to the eyes. Over time, this can lead to blindness. Leg ulcers. Sickle cell anemia can cause painful open sores on the legs. Gallstones. The breakdown of red blood cells produces a substance called bilirubin. A high level of bilirubin in the body can lead to gallstones. Priapism. Sickle cell anemia can cause painful, long-lasting erections, known as priapism. Sickle cells can block the blood vessels in the penis, which can lead to impotence over time. Deep vein thrombosis. Sickled red blood cells can cause blood clots, increasing the risk of a clot lodging in a deep vein, known as deep vein thrombosis. It also increases the risk of a blood clot lodging in a lung, known as pulmonary embolism. Either can cause serious illness or even death. Pregnancy complications. Sickle cell anemia can increase the risk of high blood pressure and blood clots during pregnancy. It also can increase the risk of miscarriage, premature birth and low birth weight babies. Prevention If you carry the sickle cell trait, it can help to see a genetic counselor before you get pregnant. A counselor can help you understand your risk of having a child with sickle cell anemia. You also can learn about possible treatments, preventive measures and reproductive options." 
python3 medical_database/SpacyParse.py -s "https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/14508-thalassemias  Thalassemias Thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder that affects your body’s ability to produce hemoglobin and healthy red blood cells. Types include alpha and beta thalassemia. Thalassemia may cause you to experience anemia-like symptoms that range from mild to severe. Treatment can consist of blood transfusions and iron chelation therapy.  Contents Overview Symptoms and Causes Diagnosis and Tests Management and Treatment Prevention Outlook / Prognosis Living With Contents Overview Symptoms and Causes Diagnosis and Tests Management and Treatment Prevention Outlook / Prognosis Living With Overview What is thalassemia? Thalassemia (thal-uh-SEE-me-uh) is an inherited blood disorder. It affects your body’s ability to produce normal hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells. It allows your red blood cells to transport oxygen throughout your body, nourishing your body’s other cells.  If you have thalassemia, your body produces fewer healthy hemoglobin proteins, and your bone marrow produces fewer healthy red blood cells. The condition of having fewer red blood cells is called anemia. As red blood cells serve the vital role of delivering oxygen to tissues in your body, not having enough healthy red blood cells can deprive your body’s cells of the oxygen they need to make energy and thrive.  How does thalassemia affect my body? Thalassemia can cause mild or severe anemia and other complications over time (such as iron overload). Symptoms of anemia include:  Fatigue. Trouble breathing. Feeling cold. Dizziness. Pale skin. Who is at risk for thalassemia? The gene mutations that cause thalassemia arose in humanity as partial protections against malaria. So, thalassemia affects people who have ancestral links to parts of the world where malaria is prevalent, such as Africa, Southern Europe and West, South and East Asia. Thalassemia is inherited, which means the condition is passed from a biological parent to their child.  Symptoms and Causes What causes thalassemia? Hemoglobin consists of four protein chains, two alpha globin chains and two beta globin chains. Each chain — both alpha and beta — contains genetic information, or genes, passed down from your parents. Think of these genes as the “code” or programming that controls each chain and (as a result) your hemoglobin. If any of these genes are defective or missing, you’ll have thalassemia.  Alpha globin protein chains consist of four genes, two from each parent. Beta globin protein chains consist of two genes, one from each parent. The thalassemia you have depends on whether your alpha or beta chain contains the genetic defect. The extent of the defect will determine how severe your condition is.  What are the types of thalassemia? Thalassemia is classified as trait, minor, intermedia and major to describe how severe the condition is. These labels represent a range where having a thalassemia trait means that you may experience mild anemia symptoms or no symptoms at all. You may not need treatment. Thalassemia major is the most serious form and usually requires regular treatment.  There are two types of thalassemia — alpha thalassemia and beta thalassemia — named after defects in these chains.  Alpha thalassemia You inherit four genes, two from each parent, that make alpha globin protein chains. When one or more genes are defective, you develop alpha thalassemia. The number of defective genes you inherit will determine whether you experience anemia symptoms and (if so) how severe they’ll be.  One defective or missing alpha gene means that you won’t experience symptoms. Another name for this condition is alpha thalassemia minima. Two defective or missing alpha genes means that if you experience symptoms, they’ll likely be mild. Another name is alpha thalassemia minor. Three defective or missing alpha genes means that you’ll experience moderate to severe symptoms. Another name for this condition is Hemoglobin H disease. Four defective or missing alpha genes usually results in death. In those rare instances when a newborn survives, they’ll likely need lifelong blood transfusions. Another name for this condition is hydrops fetalis with Hemoglobin Barts. Beta thalassemia You inherit two beta-globin genes, one from each parent. Your anemia symptoms and how severe your condition is depends on how many genes are defective and which part of the beta globin protein chain contains the defect.  One defective or missing beta gene means that you’ll experience mild symptoms. Another name for this condition is beta thalassemia minor. Two defective or missing beta genes means that you’ll experience moderate to severe symptoms. The moderate version is called thalassemia intermedia. More severe beta thalassemia involving two gene mutations is called beta thalassemia major or Cooley’s anemia. What are the symptoms of thalassemia? Your experience will depend on the type of thalassemia you have and how severe it is.  Asymptomatic (no symptoms) You likely won’t have symptoms if you’re missing one alpha gene. If you’re missing two alpha genes or one beta gene, you may be asymptomatic. Or, you may have mild anemia symptoms, like fatigue.  Mild to moderate symptoms Beta thalassemia intermedia may cause mild anemia symptoms, or it may cause the following symptoms associated with more moderate disease:  Growth problems. Delayed puberty. Bone abnormalities, such as osteoporosis. An enlarged spleen (the organ in your abdomen that plays a part in fighting infection). You may eventually need surgery to correct skeletal problems. Your healthcare provider may need to remove your spleen if it grows too large.  Severe symptoms Missing three alpha genes (Hemoglobin H disease) often causes anemia symptoms at birth and leads to severe lifelong anemia. Beta thalassemia major (Cooley’s anemia) often leads to severe anemia symptoms noticeable by age 2.  Symptoms of severe anemia include those associated with mild to moderate disease. Additional symptoms may include:  Poor appetite. Pale or yellowish skin (jaundice). Urine that’s dark or tea-colored. Irregular bone structure in your face. Diagnosis and Tests How is thalassemia diagnosed? Moderate and severe thalassemia are often diagnosed in childhood because symptoms usually appear within the first two years of your child’s life.  Your healthcare provider may order various blood tests to diagnose thalassemia:  A complete blood count (CBC) that includes measures of hemoglobin and the quantity (and size) of red blood cells. People with thalassemia have fewer healthy red blood cells and less hemoglobin than normal. They may also have smaller-than-normal red blood cells. A reticulocyte count (a measure of young red blood cells) may indicate that your bone marrow isn’t producing enough red blood cells. Studies of iron will indicate whether the cause of your anemia is an iron deficiency or thalassemia. Hemoglobin electrophoresis is used to diagnose beta thalassemia. Genetic testing is used to diagnose alpha thalassemia. Management and Treatment How is thalassemia treated? Standard treatments for thalassemia major are blood transfusions and iron chelation.  A blood transfusion involves receiving injections of red blood cells through a vein to restore normal levels of healthy red blood cells and hemoglobin. You’ll receive transfusions every four months with moderate or severe thalassemia, and with beta thalassemia major, every two to four weeks. Occasional transfusions may be needed (for instance, during times of infection) for hemoglobin H disease or beta thalassemia intermedia. Iron chelation involves the removal of excess iron from your body. A danger with blood transfusions is that they can cause iron overload. Too much iron may damage organs. If you receive frequent transfusions, you’ll receive iron chelation therapy (which you can take as a pill). Folic acid supplements can help your body make healthy blood cells. Bone marrow and stem cell transplant from a compatible related donor is the only treatment to cure thalassemia. Compatibility means the donor has the same types of proteins, called human leukocyte antigens (HLA), on the surface of their cells as the person receiving the transplant. Your healthcare provider will inject bone marrow stem cells from your donor into your bloodstream during the procedure. The transplanted cells will start to make new, healthy blood cells within one month. Luspatercept is an injection that’s given every three weeks and can help your body make more red blood cells. It’s approved in the U.S. for the treatment of transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia. What are the complications of thalassemia? Your body may get too much iron (iron overload), either from frequent blood transfusions or the disease itself. Too much iron can cause damage to your heart, liver, and endocrine system. Your endocrine system includes glands that produce hormones that regulate processes throughout your body.  You may get frequent severe infections, especially if you receive a lot of blood transfusions. The infections may be carried in the blood you receive during a transfusion. Healthcare providers carefully screen donor blood during transfusions to prevent this from happening.  Prevention Can thalassemia be prevented? You can’t prevent thalassemia, but genetic testing can reveal whether you or your partner carry the gene. Knowing this information can help you plan your pregnancy if you plan to conceive.  Speak to a genetic counselor for guidance on family planning if you suspect you or your partner may carry gene mutations for thalassemia.  Outlook / Prognosis Can thalassemia be cured? A bone marrow transplant from a compatible sibling offers the best chance at a cure for thalassemia. Unfortunately, most people with thalassemia lack a suitable sibling donor. Also, a bone marrow transplant is a high-risk procedure that may result in severe complications, including death.  Meet with a thalassemia specialist to determine whether you’re a candidate for a transplant. Choosing a high-volume hospital that regularly handles bone marrow transplants improves your chance of a cure while reducing your risk of complications.  What is the life expectancy of someone with thalassemia? You should expect a normal life expectancy if you have mild thalassemia. Even if your condition is moderate or severe, you have a good chance of long-term survival if you follow your treatment program (transfusions and iron chelation therapy).  Heart disease from iron overload is the leading cause of death in people with thalassemia, so keeping up with your iron chelation therapy is extremely important.  Living With What kind of ongoing care will I need? You’ll need frequent complete blood counts and blood iron tests. Your healthcare provider may recommend yearly heart function and liver function tests. They may also recommend tests for viral infection (as having thalassemia increases your risk of certain serious infections). You also will need a yearly test for iron overload in your liver.  A note from Cleveland Clinic  Thalassemia is a treatable condition. Your symptoms, the types of treatments you’ll need and how often you’ll need them depend on how mild or severe your thalassemia is. Ask your healthcare provider how your condition will determine your need for ongoing care. If you’re planning to become pregnant and suspect you or your partner may carry genes for thalassemia, seek testing and advice from a genetic counselor."

Causes Thalassemia is caused by mutations in the DNA of cells that make hemoglobin — the substance in red blood cells that carries oxygen throughout your body. The mutations associated with thalassemia are passed from parents to children.  Hemoglobin molecules are made of chains called alpha and beta chains that can be affected by mutations. In thalassemia, the production of either the alpha or beta chains are reduced, resulting in either alpha-thalassemia or beta-thalassemia.  In alpha-thalassemia, the severity of thalassemia you have depends on the number of gene mutations you inherit from your parents. The more mutated genes, the more severe your thalassemia.  In beta-thalassemia, the severity of thalassemia you have depends on which part of the hemoglobin molecule is affected.  Alpha-thalassemia Four genes are involved in making the alpha hemoglobin chain. You get two from each of your parents. If you inherit:  One mutated gene, you'll have no signs or symptoms of thalassemia. But you are a carrier of the disease and can pass it on to your children. Two mutated genes, your thalassemia signs and symptoms will be mild. This condition might be called alpha-thalassemia trait. Three mutated genes, your signs and symptoms will be moderate to severe. Inheriting four mutated genes is rare and usually results in stillbirth. Babies born with this condition often die shortly after birth or require lifelong transfusion therapy. In rare cases, a child born with this condition can be treated with transfusions and a stem cell transplant.  Beta-thalassemia Two genes are involved in making the beta hemoglobin chain. You get one from each of your parents. If you inherit:  One mutated gene, you'll have mild signs and symptoms. This condition is called thalassemia minor or beta-thalassemia. Two mutated genes, your signs and symptoms will be moderate to severe. This condition is called thalassemia major, or Cooley anemia.  Babies born with two defective beta hemoglobin genes usually are healthy at birth but develop signs and symptoms within the first two years of life. A milder form, called thalassemia intermedia, also can result from two mutated genes.  Risk factors Factors that increase your risk of thalassemia include:  Family history of thalassemia. Thalassemia is passed from parents to children through mutated hemoglobin genes. Certain ancestry. Thalassemia occurs most often in African Americans and in people of Mediterranean and Southeast Asian descent. Complications Possible complications of moderate to severe thalassemia include:  Iron overload. People with thalassemia can get too much iron in their bodies, either from the disease or from frequent blood transfusions. Too much iron can result in damage to your heart, liver and endocrine system, which includes hormone-producing glands that regulate processes throughout your body. Infection. People with thalassemia have an increased risk of infection. This is especially true if you've had your spleen removed. In cases of severe thalassemia, the following complications can occur:  Bone deformities. Thalassemia can make your bone marrow expand, which causes your bones to widen. This can result in abnormal bone structure, especially in your face and skull. Bone marrow expansion also makes bones thin and brittle, increasing the chance of broken bones. Enlarged spleen. The spleen helps your body fight infection and filter unwanted material, such as old or damaged blood cells. Thalassemia is often accompanied by the destruction of a large number of red blood cells. This causes your spleen to enlarge and work harder than normal.  An enlarged spleen can make anemia worse, and it can reduce the life of transfused red blood cells. If your spleen grows too big, your doctor might suggest surgery to remove it.  Slowed growth rates. Anemia can both slow a child's growth and delay puberty. Heart problems. Congestive heart failure and abnormal heart rhythms can be associated with severe thalassemia. Prevention In most cases, you can't prevent thalassemia. If you have thalassemia, or if you carry a thalassemia gene, consider talking with a genetic counselor for guidance if you want to have children.  There is a form of assisted reproductive technology diagnosis, which screens an embryo in its early stages for genetic mutations combined with in vitro fertilization. This might help parents who have thalassemia or who are carriers of a defective hemoglobin gene have healthy babies.  The procedure involves retrieving mature eggs and fertilizing them with sperm in a dish in a laboratory. The embryos are tested for the defective genes, and only those without genetic defects are implanted into the uterus."
